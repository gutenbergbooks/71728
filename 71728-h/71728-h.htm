<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p>“Under the Mikado’s Flag” relates the
adventures of two young Americans in Korea and
Manchuria during the outbreak of the great war
between Russia and Japan, which has for its primary
object the settling of the vexing question of how
much of the Liao-tung Peninsula shall remain under
Russian control, and whether or not this control
shall eventually be extended to Korea.</p>

<p>In the tale are related some of the causes which
led up to this struggle, and also the particulars of the
sinking of many ships of war, the numerous attacks
upon Port Arthur, the landing of the Japanese
troops at Chemulpo and other points, and the
advance northward through Korea to the Yalu
River. Here the Russians made a strong stand,
but being outnumbered they were forced to retreat;
and then followed numerous other skirmishes and
battles, leading up to the great conflict before Liao-Yang,
in which half a million men fought desperately
for days—an encounter which has few parallels in
modern history.</p>

<p>To those who have read a previous volume of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</span>
mine, entitled “On to Pekin,” the leading character
of the present story will perhaps seem like an old
friend. Gilbert Pennington had already served in
Cuba, in the Philippines, and in China, so it was no
new thing for him to don a soldier’s uniform and go
forth to fight as of yore. And what was true of the
young man who had once been a lieutenant of the
United States regulars, was likewise true of his
bosom chum, Ben Russell, and their faithful old
comrades-in-arms, Carl Stummer and Dan Casey.</p>

<p>At the present writing it is impossible to predict
what the outcome of this great war will be. The
resources of Russia are tremendous, but that nation
has many troubles at home. On the other hand, the
sturdy Japanese are fighting with wonderful bravery
thinking nothing of facing death at every turn and
with a strategy which is as successful as it
is astonishing.</p>

<p>Once more let me thank my young friends for the
interest they have shown in my previous books.
May they find the present volume equally interesting
and profitable.</p>

<p>“Then you have no idea what has become of
this Ivan Snokoff, Mr. Chase?”</p>

<p>“Not the slightest, Lieutenant Pennington. I
met him at Dalny about a month ago, but since that
time I have not seen him.”</p>

<p>“Can you give me any information concerning
this trading company of which he was the head?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” was the slow answer. Nathan Chase
rubbed his chin reflectively. “Would you mind
telling me why you put the question?”</p>

<p>“The answer is simple enough,” replied Gilbert
Pennington. “As you know, I am connected with
the Richmond Importing Company, of the United
States.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know that. They tell me you are one of
the principal stockholders.”</p>

<p>“I am a stockholder, although not the principal
one. But I am also connected with the company<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
as a selling agent. About six months ago our
concern sold Ivan Snokoff five thousand dollars’
worth of goods. We have been trying to collect the
bill ever since.”</p>

<p>“Phew! No wonder you are interested. Is the
whole amount still due?”</p>

<p>“No, one thousand dollars have been paid. But
it looks now as if we should have to whistle for the
remaining four thousand unless I can lay my hands
on Snokoff.”</p>

<p>“I thought there was something crooked about
Snokoff and his company from the very start,” went
on Nathan Chase, as he settled back in his office
chair. “They didn’t do business in the fair and
square fashion of most Russian firms. They sold
goods almost regardless of cost. No firm can do
that and pay its debts. They claimed to be establishing
trade, but trade established in that manner
isn’t worth having.”</p>

<p>“I agree with you.”</p>

<p>“The offices across the way were shut up ten
days ago. Only a clerk and a porter were in charge.
They have disappeared like them employer.”</p>

<p>“Can you give me their names?”</p>

<p>“The clerk’s name was Vanskynov. Somebody
said he came to Port Arthur from Mukden. I know
nothing of the porter.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span></p>

<p>“It’s too bad.” Gilbert Pennington drew a long
breath. “I’d give a few dollars just to lay my
hands on this Ivan Snokoff. I’d let him know what
I thought of him.”</p>

<p>“Have you reported the affair to the authorities?”</p>

<p>“Not yet. I have been hoping right along
that I might spot Snokoff somewhere. Besides,
matters here seem to be very unsettled just
now.”</p>

<p>“You are right there, lieutenant. And they may
be more unsettled before long.”</p>

<p>“Do you think there will be war between Russia
and Japan?”</p>

<p>“It looks very much like it. How long have you
been in Manchuria?”</p>

<p>“I came over from Nagasaki a week ago.”</p>

<p>“Then you know but little of affairs here. Russia
has been fortifying this port for several months, and
our harbor is filled with warships.”</p>

<p>“I saw some of the warships as our vessel came
up the harbor. If war should come, Port Arthur
may have a hot time of it.”</p>

<p>“Exactly.” There was a pause. “Anything
else I can do for you, lieutenant? If not, I’ll get
at my desk work. My correspondence has been
very heavy lately.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span></p>

<p>“Nothing more, Mr. Chase. I am much obliged
to you.”</p>

<p>“Not at all. I am always glad to do what I can
for a brother American. Come in again and let me
know how you make out.”</p>

<p>“I will,” answered Gilbert Pennington, and after
a hearty handshake he left the main offices of the
Anglo-Chinese Trading Company and walked
slowly up the broad and well-kept business street of
Port Arthur upon which the buildings of the concern
were located.</p>

<p>Gilbert Pennington was a young man of Southern
blood and strong military tendencies. He came
from Richmond, Virginia, and upon the death of his
parents had drifted, first to the West Indies and
then to New York. This was during the opening
of our war with Spain, and fired with patriotism,
the young Southerner entered the volunteer service
and became one of Roosevelt’s Rough Riders, as
related in one of my previous books, entitled “A
Young Volunteer in Cuba.”</p>

<p>From Cuba the young soldier shifted to the
Philippines where, in company with his old-time
chums, the Russell boys, he saw much active service
under Generals Otis and McArthur, and the much-lamented
General Lawton, many particulars of
which are given in “Under Otis in the Philippines”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
and other volumes of the “Old Glory
Series.”</p>

<p>While the young soldier was in the Philippines he
joined the regular army and shortly after this was
sent to China, to aid in the suppression of the Boxer
uprising and the rescue of many missionaries and
others who had fled to the legations in Pekin for
safety. As a lieutenant in the regulars Gilbert saw
a good deal of hard fighting, the particulars of
which have been set forth in “On to Pekin.” In
this volume are also related how the young soldier
overturned a plot to cheat him out of his legal share
of stock of the Richmond Importing Company, and
how he at last came into possession of sixteen thousand
dollars of stock which was then worth exactly
twice its face value.</p>

<p>Since those strenuous days many changes had
taken place. With the rebellion in the Philippines
and the uprising in China at an end, the young
American had left the army as speedily as possible
and applied himself strictly to business. New men
were now at the head of the Importing Company,
and as Gilbert had a fair knowledge of Japan,
Korea, and the eastern coast of China, he was made
the selling agent in that territory. For over a year
he had done very well at this receiving both a
salary and a commission, with all expenses paid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span></p>

<p>The first real snag had been struck when he had
started to do business with Ivan Snokoff, who
represented himself as the head of the Russian-American
Importing and Exporting Company, with
headquarters at Port Arthur,—a city leased to the
Russians by China, and located at the extreme
southern part of the Liao-tung Peninsula of Manchuria.</p>

<p>Snokoff could speak English fairly well, and he
was one of the smoothest talkers possible to imagine.
He said he had many relatives in the United States,
and loved to do business with the Yankees because
they were so straightforward and honest.</p>

<p>“I lof not the Germans or the Englees,” said
Ivan Snokoff. “It is them who are too sharp for
the poor Russian, yes. Ivan Snokoff will trade
with his friend Pennington, yes—then he will be
safe,” and he nearly crushed Gilbert’s fingers with
the warmth of his grasp.</p>

<p>Gilbert was too easy-going to see through such a
wily schemer as Ivan Snokoff. He took the Russian’s
words in good faith, and a mere statement
from several others that Snokoff undoubtedly had
money was accepted without question. He also
learned that a certain Captain Barusky had a share
in the Russian company, and that the Baruskys
were wealthy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span></p>

<p>The first consignment of goods had amounted to
four hundred dollars and the second to twelve hundred
dollars. Both consignments had been paid for
promptly, and Gilbert and the others connected with
the Richmond Company had congratulated themselves
on having acquired such a customer at Port
Arthur, which was rather a hard city in which to
sell American goods.</p>

<p>Then came the five-thousand-dollar order. “I
have a great chance to make much money, yes,” said
Ivan Snokoff. “Send the goods quickly, and I will
discount the whole bill. Do not delay, no—or my
rival will get the order instead of me.” And the
goods were shipped as quickly as possible, Gilbert
sending the order by cablegram. Ivan Snokoff was
truly delighted and spoke enthusiastically of his
profits. But the settlement was delayed from time
to time, and then suddenly the Russian disappeared,
the offices were closed up, and it slowly dawned
upon Gilbert and the Company that they had been
led into a trap and swindled.</p>

<p>At first the young American knew not what to do.
He was in a foreign country, and his Russian rivals
had never wanted him to do business there. Not
one of them was willing to give him any information
concerning Snokoff or his connections, and at
the bank it was stated that the rascal had closed his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
account and not shown himself since. Even the customhouse
officials could tell nothing. Gilbert had
feared to go to the police, knowing that the police
department of Russia is a wonderful and fearful
institution, and that the officers might lock him up
for having had anything to do with Snokoff in the
first place.</p>

<p>“But I’m going to bring that fellow to justice
somehow,” said Gilbert to himself more than once.
“He shan’t escape as easily as he thinks.”</p>

<p>Mr. Nathan Chase was an American merchant
who did business both at Port Arthur and at Tien-Tsin.
Gilbert had met him once at the latter city,
while the young American was still a soldier. The
merchant had just come back to Port Arthur after
a trip to Pekin, and as soon as Gilbert heard of this
he made the call which has just been described.</p>

<p>Gilbert knew that a war between Japan and Russia
would greatly complicate matters. He had heard
about this at Nagasaki, and could now see that preparations
for resisting an attack had been going
forward in and around Port Arthur during the
entire winter. All the forts had been strengthened,
and the city was filled with soldiers from Russia.
Many of the Chinese and Japanese residents of the
place were leaving, and the railroad station was
crowded from morning to night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p>“If Port Arthur should be attacked by the
Japanese, everything will be upset here,” thought
the young American dismally. “In the excitement
such a thing as having Snokoff arrested will be out
of the question. I wish——”</p>

<p>Gilbert’s thoughts were interrupted at this
moment by the appearance of a young man who was
hurrying along the street, a bundle in each hand. A
second look at the fellow convinced the young
American that the individual was Ivan Snokoff’s
clerk.</p>

<p>“Hold on!” he shouted, and running forward,
caught the clerk by the arm. The fellow stopped,
looked at the young American in alarm, and then
tried to jerk away.</p>

<p>“Let me go,” he said, in Russian.</p>

<p>“I wish to talk to you,” answered Gilbert, who
had picked up a smattering of the language.</p>

<p>“What do you want?”</p>

<p>“I want to know what has become of Ivan
Snokoff.”</p>

<p>“I know not.”</p>

<p>“You worked for him. How came you to close
up the offices so unexpectedly?”</p>

<p>“By my master’s orders.”</p>

<p>“Do you know he owes our company a great deal
of money?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>At this the young Russian shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“What have I to do with that? You made your
bargain with him, not with me.”</p>

<p>“That is true, but if you are honest you will not
mind telling me where he is.”</p>

<p>“Have I not said that I do not know?” The
clerk hesitated and then squinted at Gilbert suggestively.
“No, I cannot tell you where Ivan
Snokoff is, but—but——”</p>

<p>“But what?”</p>

<p>“Sire, I am a poor man, and I have a wife and
two children to support.”</p>

<p>“You are too young to have a wife and two
children.”</p>

<p>“No, sire, it is true. I was seventeen when I
was married, and Ulma, my wife, was but fifteen.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say you need money?”</p>

<p>“It is true. Ivan Snokoff left me without work,
and owing me money. I have next to nothing saved.
To-day I am moving my family to poorer quarters.
In another two weeks my money will all be
gone.”</p>

<p>“What has all this to do with me?”</p>

<p>“’Tis plain enough, sire. You need information,
Nicholas Vanskynov needs money. Let us make
an exchange.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p>“You will tell me something of value if I will
pay you for it?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“How much do you want?”</p>

<p>Again the young Russian shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“What shall I say? You are a rich man and will
never miss a few <em>rubles</em>.”</p>

<p>“Well, I shall not mind paying you a few <em>rubles</em>
if you can really tell me something of value,” answered
Gilbert.</p>

<p>“Then come to some place where it is warm and
I will tell you all I know,” returned Nicholas
Vanskynov.</p>

<span class="fs80">GILBERT LEARNS SOMETHING</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The winter had been long and severe in Manchuria,
and even now, early in February, it was
biting cold and with a touch of snow in the air at
Port Arthur.</p>

<p>Close at hand was a shop where refreshments of
various kinds could be had and to this place Gilbert
led the way making certain that the Russian followed.
He saw at a glance that Nicholas Vanskynov
was a fellow of small caliber and could readily be
handled if given a little money. Sitting down to a
table he ordered a cup of coffee and some fancy
cakes for himself and asked the other what he
would have.</p>

<p>“Since you are so kind, I will take a glass of
<em>quass</em>,” was the answer, <em>quass</em> being a sour beer
much used by Russians.</p>

<p>“Now, what can you tell me of value?” asked the
young American, after the refreshments had been
brought and Vanskynov had partaken of the liquor
with apparent satisfaction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p>“Let us first speak of the reward, sire.”</p>

<p>“How much do you want?” demanded Gilbert
sharply. “Remember, I can hand you over to the
police, if I desire.”</p>

<p>“The police!” At the threat the young Russian
grew pale, for the police department is a terror to
all who live under Russian law, its findings being
generally final and absolute. “How so?”</p>

<p>“For aiding Ivan Snokoff to get away without
paying his just debts.”</p>

<p>“I did not aid him, no, no! When he went I
thought all was right—I did not learn the truth
until later. I have lost much myself, for I thought
I was to have a steady position with him.”</p>

<p>“How much do you want me to pay you?”</p>

<p>“Not much, sire, no. Surely you will never miss
ten <em>rubles</em>,” went on the young Russian, mentioning
a sum less than eight dollars, a Russian <em>ruble</em> being
worth, at the present time, 76 to 78 cents.</p>

<p>“Can you give me information of value?”</p>

<p>“I think I can.”</p>

<p>“Then tell me what you know, and if the news is
worth anything you shall have your money.”</p>

<p>“Ah, I knew the American would be generous to
a poor Russian—the United States is a great
country.”</p>

<p>“What do you know?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p>“It is of Captain Barusky that I would speak—he
who comes of a most honorable family.”</p>

<p>“The same captain that had an interest in the
trading company?” questioned Gilbert quickly.</p>

<p>“Yes, the same. He and Ivan Snokoff are great
friends—I have heard that they have been in many
business ventures together.”</p>

<p>“Do you know where Captain Barusky is?”</p>

<p>“He was out of active service for several years,
but now he is once more in the army. Since it looks
so much like war with Japan the Czar has called
upon all our country’s defenders to take their proper
places in the army and the navy.”</p>

<p>“And where is this Captain Barusky stationed?”</p>

<p>“He was at Mukden, but I have heard that he
was seen at one of the forts of this port only day
before yesterday.”</p>

<p>“What fort?”</p>

<p>“That I cannot tell, but I think it was the one
nearest to the dry dock.”</p>

<p>“I am glad to know this,” said Gilbert slowly.
He was wondering how he could get hold of his
man. “Do you know for a fact that he was a
partner in the company?”</p>

<p>“Yes, for I once saw the papers. Besides, he
once lent Ivan Snokoff six hundred <em>rubles</em> with
which to pay off certain bills for goods, and I know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
he shared in the profits. They were a pair of sly
foxes. Were I you, I should have this bold captain
held by the authorities. It may be he will then
reveal what has become of Ivan Snokoff.”</p>

<p>“I’ll certainly do something—if I can find him.”
Gilbert was silent for a moment. “Give me your
new address,” he continued. “I may want you
again.”</p>

<p>“And the <em>rubles</em>——”</p>

<p>“Here they are,” and the young American
counted out the amount in Russian scrip, for silver
<em>rubles</em> are now but seldom seen. “I’ll give you a
good deal more, if you’ll aid me to get back what
belongs to our company.”</p>

<p>“Nicholas Vanskynov is at your service, sire.
Here is the address,” and it was written down in
a notebook which Gilbert brought forth.</p>

<p>After this the young American questioned the
Russian clerk closely concerning Ivan Snokoff’s
methods of doing business. He learned that all
the goods sold had been shipped out of Manchuria,
so that to trace them farther was next to impossible.
Beyond a doubt Captain Barusky was hand-in-glove
with Snokoff, and the pair had cleaned up a
good many thousand dollars by their nefarious
actions.</p>

<p>After parting with the Russian clerk, Gilbert<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
attended to various matters of business for the
balance of that day and also for the morning of the
next. While he war near the railroad station he
saw a long train come in from the north packed with
soldiers.</p>

<p>“This certainly looks like war,” he reasoned, as
he watched the soldiers leave the train and march
off to a temporary barracks. “And those chaps look
as if they meant business, too,” he continued, noticing
how well the body was drilled. “I declare, it
arouses my old fighting blood just to look at them!”
And he drew himself up as of old, when he was a
lieutenant under Old Glory.</p>

<p>War talk was everywhere, and Russians and foreigners
of all sorts filled the streets and discussed the
situation in subdued tones. The Japanese said but
little, and the Russians gave them the blackest of
looks as they passed by.</p>

<p>The strained situation between Japan and Russia
was of long standing. In a work of this kind it is
not necessary to go into all the details which led to
the great war which was so close at hand. Sufficient
be it to say that Japan objected strongly to
having any part of China or Korea held by Russia,
and viewed with alarm the strong fortifications of
Port Arthur, the building of the great Trans-Siberian
railroad from the frontier to the port itself,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
and the occupation of other Chinese towns by the
Russians.</p>

<p>“In but a few years more Russia will claim both
Manchuria and Korea,” said the Japanese, “and
then our own safety will be menaced.” Which was
certainly true, for the islands that make up the kingdom
of Japan lie directly to the southeast of the territory
named, with nothing but the Sea of Japan
between. More than this, the occupation of Manchuria
and Korea by the Russians would interfere
seriously with Japanese trade—a commerce that
amounted to many millions of dollars annually.</p>

<p>This was the Japanese side of the story. On the
Russian side, that country claimed it was not occupying
anything for which it had not paid, and it
was merely establishing itself in Manchuria to preserve
peace and order.</p>

<p>“If we leave the Chinese to themselves in Manchuria
no foreigners doing business there will be
safe,” said the Russians. “The railroad is bound
to come sooner or later, and we may as well build
and own it as to leave the work to somebody else.”
This was fair talk, yet the world at large felt that
the whole scheme was one meant to enlarge Russian
territory and power, and do it largely at ultimate
expense to Japan.</p>

<p>Port Arthur is a commercial city of considerable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
size, located at the base of a series of hills overlooking
the sea beyond. The entrance to the harbor itself,
which is directly in front of the city, is long
and narrow. On each spur of land are several forts,
and beyond those on the right, as the harbor is entered,
is a large basin, with a single dry dock. On
the left is what is called West Port. The inner harbor
is somewhat oval in shape, two miles wide from
east to west, and a mile wide north to south.</p>

<p>As already mentioned, the fortifications were
strong, yet the Russian authorities were doing all
in their power to make them stronger. They were
likewise bringing into the city vast quantities of
supplies, for what purpose the foreigners could only
imagine. Every mile of the railroad was being
closely guarded, so that the Chinese natives, known
to be friendly to the Japanese, might not tear up the
tracks.</p>

<p>Gilbert knew that there were four forts located at
the entrance to the harbor, and he determined to
visit these before going to the other strongholds
about the city. He understood very well that he
would not be permitted inside any of the forts, but
thought there would be no objections to his making
inquiries about Captain Barusky.</p>

<p>“Those higher in command will certainly want to
know what sort of a man he is,” thought Gilbert.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
“I don’t think they’ll endure anything crooked,
even though they don’t want us Americans to take
away Russian trade.”</p>

<p>His visit to the first fort was a failure. He was
halted while still some distance off and asked his
business.</p>

<p>“I am looking for a certain Captain Barusky,”
said he. “Is he located here?”</p>

<p>The guard did not know.</p>

<p>“Can you find out for me?” was Gilbert’s next
question.</p>

<p>“Not at present. Come in two hours. I shall be
relieved then.”</p>

<p>This was all the young American could get out of
the guard, and he was told, if he remained where he
was, he would be arrested. Hearing this, Gilbert
lost no time in hurrying away.</p>

<p>Some time later he was in the vicinity of the second
fort. A great lot of extra stores had arrived
and all was in confusion. Some Chinese coolies
were handling the stuff and now some Russian soldiers
came out to assist them, grumbling loudly
because toe Chinese could not do the work
alone.</p>

<p>Gilbert was greatly interested in the work of the
coolies. Evidently they had to carry their loads to
the very heart of the fort, for each was blindfolded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
and had to take hold of a rope, the front end of
which was in the hands of a Russian sergeant. The
sergeant brandished a whip, and if a coolie did not
move to suit him, he would give the fellow a cut
with the lash.</p>

<p>“This is certainly tough on the Chinamen,”
thought the young American. “It’s a wonder they
don’t revolt. If they wanted to, they could make
matters warm for the Russians.”</p>

<p>The coolies having disappeared for the time being,
the Russian soldiers came up for their loads.
With them were several officers, one of whom eyed
Gilbert narrowly.</p>

<p>All unconscious of what was taking place, Gilbert
drew a little closer to the stores. Then of a sudden
he felt a hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p>“What are you doing here?” demanded the Russian
officer.</p>

<p>Gilbert was slightly startled and drew back. But
the grip upon his shoulder was not relaxed.</p>

<p>“Tell me what you are doing here?” repeated
the officer.</p>

<p>“Not very much,” was the young American’s
answer.</p>

<p>“I saw you at the other fort a while ago.”</p>

<p>“That is true. I was——”</p>
<br>

<p>“Don’t try to explain here. Come with me. We

You are an American, I believe.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“So much the worse for you. Come with me.”</p>

<p>And somewhat against his will Gilbert was
marched off to one of the buildings inside of the
fortifications.</p>

<span class="fs80">DETAINED BY THE RUSSIANS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>In spite of the fact, well known to all in Port
Arthur, that the Russians allowed no foreigners in
or near their forts, Gilbert was much astonished to
find himself virtually a prisoner of the officer who
had detained him.</p>

<p>Almost before he knew it, he found himself in a
small office attached to the fort proper. Here two
burly soldiers were on guard, and each scowled
ominously at him.</p>

<p>“I reckon I’ve put my foot into it this time,” he
told himself.</p>

<p>He wished to explain to the officer, but the latter
would not listen. A few words were spoken to one
of the soldiers, in a Siberian dialect which Gilbert
could not understand, and then the officer left as
quickly as he had come.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do with me?” questioned
the young American, after a moment of
silence.</p>

<p>At this query each of the Russian soldiers merely
shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>

<p>“You have no right to detain me in this manner,”
went on Gilbert. “I am an American citizen and
have done no wrong.”</p>

<p>For answer one of the soldiers motioned him to a
bench and placed his rather dirty hand over Gilbert’s
mouth, at the same time raising his gun. It was a
hint to sit down and keep quiet, and feeling it would
be useless to resist, Gilbert did as suggested.</p>

<p>Half an hour dragged by slowly, and the young
American was growing impatient, when the officer
who had first accosted him came back, accompanied
by a dark, surly individual dressed in the uniform of
a captain.</p>

<p>“Here is the American,” said the first of the pair.
“I found him watching us rather closely.”</p>

<p>“Ha!” came from the second. He turned to
Gilbert. “And what have you to say for yourself?”</p>

<p>“What is there to say?” returned the young
American boldly. “Certainly I have done no
wrong.”</p>

<p>“You were acting the part of a spy.”</p>

<p>“Not at all. I am looking for a certain Captain
Barusky, who is, so I have been told, located at one
of the forts in or near this port.”</p>

<p>“Captain Barusky? That is my name.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” Gilbert was taken somewhat by surprise.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
He looked at the man closely, and the face
did not at all please him.</p>

<p>“What do you want of me? What is your
name?”</p>

<p>“I want to see you on business,” was Gilbert’s
bold answer. “My name is Gilbert Pennington,
and I am the selling agent for the Richmond Importing
Company. I think you have heard of that
concern.”</p>

<p>Captain Barusky started slightly and changed
color. But he quickly recovered and took on a look
of unconcern.</p>

<p>“I have heard of your company, yes, but I know
little about it, and nothing about you.”</p>

<p>“Probably you know more about Ivan Snokoff,”
went on Gilbert dryly.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know him quite well.”</p>

<p>“You were partners in business, so I understand.”</p>

<p>“Partners? Never! I am not a business man.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say that you did not have
an interest in the concern which Ivan Snokoff
ran?”</p>

<p>“Never. Why are you so curious to know?”</p>

<p>“Because Ivan Snokoff owes our company four
thousand dollars, and he has run away,” answered
Gilbert flatly. He felt that the man before him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
was not telling the truth. “I have been told upon
pretty good authority that you were his partner.”</p>

<p>“It is not true.” Captain Barusky glared at
Gilbert savagely. “This looks as if you had come
here to make trouble for me. Let me warn you to
beware. You cannot attack the honor of a
Russian officer recklessly.”</p>

<p>Gilbert felt the truth of the last words and resolved
to be cautious. He felt that he was among
those who were more likely to prove enemies than
friends.</p>

<p>“Then you mean to tell me that you had nothing
to do with Ivan Snokoff or his company?” he
asked, after a pause.</p>

<p>“I will not say that. I knew Snokoff fairly well,
and when he came to me for a loan I lent him
several hundred <em>rubles</em>, which, later on, he paid
back.”</p>

<p>“And you had nothing to do with the
company?”</p>

<p>“Nothing whatever.”</p>

<p>“If that is true, I must beg your pardon for
troubling you. Can you tell me where Ivan
Snokoff is?”</p>

<p>“I cannot, although I think he has gone to Liao-Yang
or Mukden.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span></p>

<p>There was a pause, which was broken by the
officer who had brought Gilbert in.</p>

<p>“Do you think he is a spy?” he questioned
abruptly.</p>

<p>“Hardly,” answered Captain Barusky, after
some hesitation.</p>

<p>“Shall we let him go?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I will see that he does not linger around
this vicinity.” The captain turned to the young
American. “Come with me, and be thankful that
you have escaped a night in the guard-house.”</p>

<p>Glad to get away at any cost, Gilbert followed
Captain Barusky from the office and out of the fort
grounds. The two walked a distance of several
rods further, when the captain came to a halt.</p>

<p>“Now you are at liberty to go,” said he, in a low
voice, so that the soldiers standing near might not
hear. “But before you do so, allow me to give
you a word of advice. Do not try to make trouble
for me, for if you do, I shall certainly make Port
Arthur too hot to hold you.” And with this warning
he turned abruptly and hurried back to the
fort.</p>

<p>For an instant Gilbert thought to answer back,
but then he shut his lips tightly and remained silent.
He was satisfied in his mind that Captain Barusky
had not told him the truth concerning Ivan Snokoff<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
and his dealings with that rascal. Yet how to get
hold of the captain in a legal way was a question.</p>

<p>“I’ll have to go slow,” he thought. “If I don’t
the captain will try to prove that I am a spy—and
then I may be put in prison or shot. I wish
this war scare was over. Then a fellow might get
down to real business.”</p>

<p>The next day was a busy one for the young
American. He had several bills to collect, and in
some instances it was hard to get the money. There
was also something wrong about a consignment of
goods, and this matter had to be straightened out
at the customhouse.</p>

<p>Gilbert had had an account at one of the banks,
but now he resolved to close this and stow his cash
about his person.</p>

<p>“There is no telling what is going to happen
soon,” he thought. “If there is any fighting here,
financial matters will be all upset. I’ll keep the
money where I can lay my hands on it.”</p>

<p>There was another matter to worry Gilbert fully
as much as did the money. He had had consigned
to several firms in Manchuria goods to the value of
sixteen thousand dollars. These goods were on
board the three-masted schooner <em>Columbia</em>, which
was now somewhere in Japanese waters, with part
of her cargo consigned to firms in Nagasaki. What<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
would happen to the schooner, if she should attempt
to come into Port Arthur during the outbreak of a
war, there was no telling.</p>

<p>“If she came here from Nagasaki, perhaps the
Russians would capture or sink her,” he reasoned.
“I wish I could get Captain Ponsberry to remain
at Nagasaki until the atmosphere clears just a
little.”</p>

<p>Gilbert knew Captain Ponsberry very well—a
sailor of the old school, who had plowed the waters
of the Pacific and the Far East for many years.
The captain had been to Manchuria twice before
and knew the surrounding waters very well.</p>

<p>“I must get word to him somehow,” said the
young American to himself. But how to send word
was a question, for no steamer was sailing and the
mails were closed.</p>

<p>On returning to the hotel at which he was stopping
Gilbert found several letters awaiting him.
The majority were business communications, but
one was of a private nature, and as soon as he beheld
the hand-writing he tore it open in surprise.</p>

<p>“From my old chum, Ben Russell!” he cried, as
he looked at the signature. “Where in the world
can he be now? I thought he had gone home to
stay there. Dated from Manila, too, and I thought
he was in Buffalo or New York.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span></p>

<p>The communication was a long one, filling sixteen
closely written pages, and ran in part as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Dear Chum Gilbert</span>: I know you will be
surprised to receive this, written from the above-named
place, but the fact of it is, I changed my
mind after writing to you that I was going home to
visit my Uncle Job Dowling, and my brothers
Larry and Walter, who left for home, as you know,
two years ago.</p>

<p>“Some time ago I received several letters from
home, including one each from Larry and Walter.
Walter has gone into business and is doing remarkably
well, so he tells me. But Larry did not
want to stay on land, and after knocking around for
the best part of a year he entered into communication
with his old friend, Captain Ponsberry of the
<em>Columbia</em>, and the upshot of the matter was that
Larry is now on board of the <em>Columbia</em>, acting as
second mate. He is certainly a sea-dog if ever
there was one, and I begin to believe he will end his
days on the ocean in spite of all we can do to make
him settle down on land.</p>

<p>“Larry knew that the old <em>Columbia</em> was carrying
a cargo for your company, and as soon as he could
he communicated with me stating that the schooner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
was going to stop at Manila while on her way to
Japan and Manchuria, and asking me to wait there
until he could see me.</p>

<p>“The <em>Columbia</em> came in several days ago, and I
can tell you I was mighty glad to see Larry, and to
see old Captain Ponsberry, too. It was like a touch
of old times, and I was sorry you and Walter were
not there. Do you remember the good time we had
at our last meeting? How we talked of all the
hardships we had endured, and of the narrow
escapes we had had? And how you told us of your
adventures in China? I shall never forget that
meeting, and of how we celebrated with a big
dinner.</p>

<p>“As soon as I saw Larry I knew he had a card up
his sleeve, and it came out pretty quick. He wanted
me to take the trip on the <em>Columbia</em>. He had arranged
it with Captain Ponsberry so that I could
have half of his quarters (Larry’s, I mean), and he
said it would give me a chance to try an ocean trip
on a sailing vessel and also an opportunity to see
you and see another part of the world.</p>

<p>“I didn’t think so much of the trip on a sailing
vessel, but I did think it would be pleasant to sail
with Larry and with our old friend the captain, and
when he mentioned you that settled it, and I said
yes almost before I knew it. And then you ought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
to have seen Larry hug me! ‘It’s just boss, Ben,’
said he. ‘We’ll have the best times ever!’ And
he fairly danced a jig over the prospect. The
captain was pleased, too, and said so.</p>

<p>“We sail early in the morning, and you know as
much about when the <em>Columbia</em> will arrive as I do.
I shall look for you either at Nagasaki or Port
Arthur, and let me say frankly that I can hardly
await the time when we shall be together again.
When I arrive you must knock off for awhile and
go sight-seeing and holiday-making with me.”</p>

<span class="fs80">TROUBLESOME DAYS IN PORT ARTHUR</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Gilbert read Ben Russell’s letter with keen
interest. The contents surprised him, just as his
chum had thought they would, and he drew a long
sigh of uncertainty as he laid the epistle down.</p>

<p>“Ben and Larry!” he murmured. “Yes, I’ll
be more than glad to meet them both, but if the old
<em>Columbia</em> gets into trouble with her cargo, what will
become of them?” And then he fell to wondering
if Ben was still wearing his uniform as a captain of
the volunteers, or if he had donned civilian’s costume.
The Russians would certainty not care for an
American officer, in uniform, among them.</p>

<p>The following afternoon took the young American
to an outlying quarter of the city. Here were
located a number of humble houses occupied largely
by Chinese and Japanese, who worked along the
wharves and at the dry dock.</p>

<p>Gilbert wanted to find a Japanese stevedore
named Jiru Siko, for he imagined that this individual
knew something about Ivan Snokoff which was,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
perhaps, unknown to Nicholas Vanskynov. He
knew that Siko lived at the end of the narrow and
dirty street, with his wife and half a dozen children.</p>

<p>As he approached the spot he noticed that something
unusual was taking place. A motley crowd
of Japanese, Chinese, and Russians had collected
near the house, and one Russian, who was armed
with a stout club, was talking loudly and commandingly.</p>

<p>“Out of the house at once, you dirty dog of a
Nippon!” came from the Russian. “Out of the
house, I say. Your being there defiles the very
walls.”</p>

<p>“I have paid the rent,” answered Jiru Siko, who
was a small man, with a hand that had been hurt
lately by having a box fall upon it. “Why cannot
I remain?”</p>

<p>“Because the dirty sons of Nippon must leave
this place,” shouted the Russian. “You are to go,
and all the others are to go, too!”</p>

<p>“And what of my rent money? Nine <em>rubles</em>, in
clean money——”</p>

<p>“The <em>rubles</em> shall go for repairs, after you have
left the house. Now out with you.”</p>

<p>“But my wife is not well. And my children——”</p>

<p>“No time have I to listen to woeful tales,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
stormed the Russian, who was merely a rent
gatherer, and who had been ordered by his rich
master to clear out all the Japanese in the street.
“Take your wife and children where you will, only
leave here, and at once.”</p>

<p>“It is unjust,” stammered Jiru Siko.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is unjust!” came in a shout from half
a dozen present.</p>

<p>“Ha, so you defy me!” shouted the Russian, in a
rage. “Shall I bring the soldiery here to make you
prisoners?”</p>

<p>At the mention of the soldiery the crowd fell back
and several Japanese and Chinese slunk out of sight.
Evidently they had had a taste of Russian law
before and wanted no more or it.</p>

<p>Scarcely knowing what to do, for his wife was
sick and his youngest child was but a babe four
months old, Jiru Siko fell back to the doorway of
his house and blocked the entrance.</p>

<p>“Come out of that!” continued the Russian.
And then, without warning, he aimed a blow with
his club at the Japanese’s head.</p>

<p>But the blow did not land as intended, for leaping
forward, Gilbert knocked the Russian rent
gatherer’s arm aside.</p>

<p>“For shame,” said the young American. “What
right have you to attack this man in this manner?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p>Astonished to have his actions interfered with,
the Russian wheeled around and confronted Gilbert.
He had expected to behold another Japanese, or a
Chinese, and when he saw an American he faltered
a little.</p>

<p>“I want him to get out of this house,” he
growled.</p>

<p>“Ah, Master Pennington!” cried Jiru Siko joyfully.
“You come best time. You help poor Jiru
Siko. No can move—no money move—no move
wife sick—no move little baby—pay rent no move,”
and he chattered away for fully a minute, doing his
best to explain the situation, which was to the effect
that he had paid rent for nearly a month longer and
that his wife was sick and must not be thrown out
on the street, along with the baby and the other
children.</p>

<p>“If this man has paid his rent, I do not see how
you can put him out,” said Gilbert sternly, to
the Russian. “It is not lawful, and you know
it.”</p>

<p>“The Japanese must go.”</p>

<p>“Then give him back his rent money.”</p>

<p>“I have it not.”</p>

<p>“Then go and get it. To take his money and
then throw him out would be robbery, and you
know it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>

<p>A wordy war followed, in which half a dozen
present participated. Supported by Gilbert, Jiru
Siko refused to budge unless his rent money was
returned, and at last the rent gatherer brought out
his purse and counted out the amount. Then
several others also demanded their money and it
was given to them, although grudgingly. From
one the rent gatherer asked who Gilbert was, and
when he was told he turned to the young American.</p>

<p>“You have caused me great trouble,” said he
savagely. “I shall take good care that you are reported.
You are no friend to Russia.”</p>

<p>“You may do as you please,” answered Gilbert
simply. Nevertheless, the rent gatherer’s words
disturbed him not a little.</p>

<p>Jiru Siko was overjoyed to get back his money
and at once made preparations to leave the house.
From him Gilbert gathered that all of the Japanese
were expected to leave Port Arthur without delay.
That the Russians now expected war there could be
no doubt.</p>

<p>The Japanese listened attentively to what the
young American had to say about Ivan Snokoff.
He could not tell what had become of the fellow,
but he was as sure as Nicholas Vanskynov had been
that Snokoff and Captain Barusky had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
partners. He also said that Barusky was the black
sheep of his family, and that the other rich members
had cast him off.</p>

<p>“Jiru Siko no forget what Master Pennington
do for ’im,” said the Japanese, on parting. “Pay
back sometime, maybe.”</p>

<p>“If war comes, what will you do, Siko?”</p>

<p>“Fight—just the same fight in China when
Master Pennington fight.”</p>

<p>“Were you in China at that time?” cried Gilbert,
with interest.</p>

<p>“Yes—fight Tien-Tsin and Pekin—stay by railroad
long time.”</p>

<p>“What about your family?”</p>

<p>“Take family to Japan first—all family Nagasaki—family
take good care wife an’ babies—gran’fadder,
gran’mudder, all Nagasaki.”</p>

<p>“Well, I hope this war cloud blows over and you
don’t have to fight,” said Gilbert; and then the two
parted.</p>

<p>Gilbert had expected to consult with Mr. Chase,
but on the following morning he learned that the
merchant had departed for Mukden, to be gone a
week or longer. The city was now agitated more
than ever, and nothing but war was talked about on
every hand.</p>

<p>Rather tired out, the young American returned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
to his hotel at six in the evening for dinner. He
was about to pass up to the room he had been occupying
when a porter stopped him.</p>

<p>“You are requested to report at the office,” said
the man respectfully.</p>

<p>Wondering what was coming next, Gilbert
walked into the office where the proprietor sat,
smoking a cigar. He was a fat and rather a jolly-looking
Russian.</p>

<p>“You wish to see me?” inquired Gilbert.</p>

<p>“I do, Mr. Pennington,” was the stiff answer.
The hotel proprietor cleared his throat. “It is
exceedingly unpleasant for me to do so, but I have
to inform you that your room has been taken by
somebody else.”</p>

<p>“My room? Why, I expected to keep it for
some time yet.”</p>

<p>“Ahem! Sorry, but I cannot let you have it any
longer.”</p>

<p>“Can you give me another just as good?”</p>

<p>“I cannot give you any room at all.”</p>

<p>Gilbert looked at the hotel proprietor, who
dropped his eyes in confusion. There was an awkward
pause.</p>

<p>“This means, I suppose, that you do not want me
here any longer?”</p>

<p>“Hardly that, Mr. Pennington. I—ahem!—I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
cannot let you have any room; that is all there is
to it.”</p>

<p>“But there must be some reason for this.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry, but I cannot offer any explanations.
Your luggage has been packed for you and stands
at the lower end of the hall. As soon as you have
settled up, you may remove it to any place you
please, or I will send it for you.”</p>

<p>“Do you think you are treating me fairly, M.
Raspan?”</p>

<p>The fat hotel man drew up his shoulders. “Personally,
I like you very much, Mr. Pennington,” he
said. “But I am powerless in this manner. Times
are not what they should be—our whole city is much
upset. I cannot harbor anybody who defends the
Japanese as you have done. M. Sandrek owns this
hotel and also owns some of the houses in which the
Japanese dwelt. You perhaps can put the tail on
the horse.”</p>

<p>“Which means that M. Sandrek, through his rent
gatherer, has ordered me from this hotel,” said
Gilbert bitterly. “Very well, I will go and at once.
How much is my bill?”</p>

<p>The hotel proprietor consulted his books. “Sixteen
<em>rubles</em> and twenty-five <em>kopecks</em>,” he said. “But
you will dine first, yes?”</p>

<p>“No, I’ll take my orders and go instantly,” returned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
Gilbert grimly. His temper was beginning
to rise, and he controlled himself with difficulty.</p>

<p>“I am powerless, Mr. Pennington. If I went
against the order——”</p>

<p>“Oh, I can understand your situation,” answered
the young American, and continued with sarcasm:
“I don’t expect every Russian to have a backbone of
his own.”</p>

<p>“We have all the backbone we need!” cried the
hotel man, and swept into his cash drawer the money
Gilbert threw on the counter. “What about your
luggage?”</p>

<p>“I will take the bag, and send for the trunk later.”</p>

<p>Once on the street Gilbert did not know which
way to turn. There was another hotel close by, but
the accommodations there were very poor. A third
hotel was several squares away. He determined to
try this and hurried in its direction.</p>

<p>“Have you just arrived in the city?” was the
first question put.</p>

<p>“No, I have been stopping here for some time,”
and the young American passed over his card.</p>

<p>“At what place?” and when he mentioned the
name of the hotel he was asked why he had left.</p>

<p>“They did not wish me to stay any longer.”</p>

<p>“Is it possible? Wait, and we will see if we can
accommodate you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span></p>

<p>Gilbert sat down, and in great haste a clerk was
sent to the hostelry at which Gilbert had been stopping.
Ten minutes later the clerk returned, and the
young American was then told that he could not be
accommodated.</p>

<p>“Here’s a state of things truly,” thought the ex-lieutenant.
“I wonder if it is going to be this way
all over.”</p>

<p>It was so at the next hotel, and also that following.
Then Gilbert found a small place kept by a
German who had a Russian wife. Business was
bad with the German, and he listened eagerly to the
offer the young American made him.</p>

<p>“I told you vot,” he said. “I keep you, but you
say noddings apout it, hey? You haf der room py
der back of der house und you eats dare, too, hey?”</p>

<p>“I’m willing,” said Gilbert; and so it was settled.
By this time he was tremendously hungry, and never
did a meal taste better than that which the German
hotel keeper set before him.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE FIRST NAVAL BATTLE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>While Gilbert was having his own troubles in
Port Arthur the differences between Russia and
Japan were speedily reaching the acute stage.</p>

<p>Long before, by the Anglo-Japanese treaty,
Russia had promised to evacuate Manchuria. But
this, as we have already seen, had not been done,
and, instead the Russians had begun to flock to
northern Korea, where a certain company obtained
mining possessions and even began to construct
fortifications.</p>

<p>These advances meant, to Japan, but one thing—the
occupation, eventually, by Russia of the whole
of Manchuria and Korea. This would become a
constant menace to Japan, and protests were at once
made at St. Petersburg, calling for a friendly settlement
between the two interested nations and China
and Korea.</p>

<p>The outcome was thoroughly unsatisfactory to
Japan. Russia contended that so far as Manchuria
was concerned she would treat only with China, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
that Japan must keep out of the muddle. Regarding
Korea she was willing to allow Japan to operate,
commercially, in the south, so long as Russia was
left alone in the north.</p>

<p>The discussion grew hotter and hotter, but Russia
would not budge in the least from the stand first
taken, and during the delay did all in her power to
put her army and navy on a war footing. Perhaps
the Russian authorities thought to catch the sons of
Nippon napping; if so, they were sadly mistaken, as
events soon after proved.</p>

<p>Negotiations were broken off on February 7,
1904. The Japanese minister left St. Petersburg,
being called home by the Japanese Cabinet sitting at
Tokio. The war was on.</p>

<p>The news was flashed around the world, and
reached Port Arthur the next day after Gilbert had
made his arrangements with the German hotel
keeper. The city was in a greater excitement than
ever, and on every corner large crowds collected, to
talk over the situation.</p>

<p>If the Russians had been hard on the Japanese
in the city before they were doubly so now, and some
of the poorer Japanese hardly knew what to do.
They were hounded from one spot to another, and,
in some instances, made to leave behind them all
they possessed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span></p>

<p>“This is what I call mean,” said Gilbert to the
hotel keeper. “The least the Russians could do
would be to let them take their things and depart in
peace.”</p>

<p>“Say noddings,” whispered the German, putting
his finger beside his nose. “Say noddings, or you
vos git into droubles ofer your head alreatty!”
And after that Gilbert was more particular as to
what he said in public. But his kindness to the
Japanese had already been observed, and he was
pointed out as one who had no sympathy with the
Russian cause.</p>

<p>“If this thing keeps on, the best I can do is to get
out of Port Arthur,” the young American told himself.
And then he thought again of the <em>Columbia</em>,
and wondered how those on board were faring.</p>

<p>Gilbert had gone to bed about ten o’clock and was
sleeping soundly, when of a sudden he awoke and sat
bolt upright.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” he demanded, half aloud,
thinking somebody had given him a shaking.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the words left his lips than he heard
a distant explosion. Then he realized that it had
been a similar sound which had aroused him.</p>

<p>“Something is wrong, that is certain,” he mused.
“That sounded like a small powder magazine going
up. Can it be that the war has really begun?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span></p>

<p>While he was meditating another explosion rent
the midnight air—this time louder than ever. Waiting
no longer, he sprang out on the floor of his room,
and donned his clothing as rapidly as possible. He
heard many folks walking through the hotel, and
footsteps could also be heard on the street, hurrying
in various directions.</p>

<p>“What does this mean?” he asked, as soon as he
was outside.</p>

<p>Nobody could tell, just then. But all said the
explosions had come from the direction of the harbor,
and hither, by common consent, the majority of
the citizens flocked.</p>

<p>With the crowd went Gilbert, and from one of
the wharves made out the searchlights of several
Russian ships of war. Several shots had in the
meanwhile been fired, but now all became as quiet
as before.</p>

<p>“Those explosions meant something, that is certain,”
said Gilbert to the hotel keeper.</p>

<p>“Vell, you haf been a soldier, you should know,”
was the reply. “Maype dem ships vos fightin’,
hey?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps, or a magazine at one of the forts blew
up.”</p>

<p>The first blow in this great contest had been
struck, and it had proved telling in the extreme. As<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
soon as the war was a certainty, Admiral Togo of
the Japanese navy left Sasebo with a squadron of
sixteen vessels and some torpedo boats, and steamed
directly for Port Arthur. The vicinity of the port
was gained on the afternoon of February 8 and at
once orders went forth to torpedo every Russian
warship that showed itself.</p>

<p>Among the Russian ships in the port at the time
were the cruiser <em>Pallada</em>, and the two battleships,
<em>Czarevitch</em> and <em>Retvizan</em>. The battleships were the
pride of the Czar’s navy, each being about thirteen
thousand tons displacement, and each having a
broadside fire of thirty-five hundred pounds.</p>

<p>The plans of the Japanese were kept carefully concealed
from the enemy, and before the Russians
could realize that anything was wrong that night,
the three ships mentioned were torpedoed,—the
torpedoes tearing great holes in their sides and
bottoms.</p>

<p>The torpedoing of the three ships occurred while
the Russian fleet, under Admiral Stark, were doing
their best to keep the Japanese warships from coming
too close to the city. The forts of Port Arthur
also opened fire, and it was in this din and confusion
that the Japanese torpedo boat destroyers slipped
close in and did their deadly work. Soon after this
Admiral Togo signaled his fleet to withdraw, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
they did, the darkness of the sea speedily swallowing
them up.</p>

<p>“Well, the war has opened at last, that is certain,”
said Gilbert, after the excitement had somewhat
subsided.</p>

<p>His own soldier blood was beginning to be
aroused, and he half wished he could get into the
fray himself.</p>

<p>“I rather guess Larry Russell would enjoy this,”
he mused, remembering how his friend had taken
part in the great naval battle of Manila Bay under
Admiral Dewey.</p>

<p>Further sleep was out of the question for the ex-lieutenant,
and at early dawn he swallowed a light
breakfast, and hastened once more to the water front,
which was now lined everywhere with people. The
excitement was at a fever heat, and it was reported
that the Japanese were going to return, to bombard
the city.</p>

<p>In his travels around Port Arthur Gilbert had
stumbled across an old stone building which, in
years gone by, had been used as a sort of storehouse
by the Manchu rulers. The building was now
practically deserted and he had no difficulty in getting
inside. There was small stone tower to the
structure, and he ascended this until he reached a
point where he could go outside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>

<p>The view from this elevated position was an excellent
one. In front of him the inner and outer
harbor of the port lay spread out as on a map, and
having brought with him a good pair of field glasses
he could see for miles.</p>

<p>“Hullo, there is certainly something wrong with
those ships,” he told himself, and then he saw the
<em>Czarevitch</em> and the <em>Retvizan</em> settled near the harbor
entrance. The <em>Pallada</em> was not so badly injured;
yet her fighting days were practically over, so far as
this war was concerned.</p>

<p>The sinking of their ships had stirred the Russian
fighting blood as it had not been stirred before, and
with the coming of daylight Admiral Stark’s men
were more than anxious to fight the Japanese vessels
in the open.</p>

<p>The opportunity was not long in arriving. Three
Japanese cruisers could be seen in the distance, and
about noon the whole fleet of sixteen fighting ships
hove into sight. When still three miles away they
opened fire on the Russian fleet and on the forts of
the harbor.</p>

<p>“Now they are going to have it hot and heavy,”
Gilbert told himself and his prediction proved correct—the
bombardment lasting over an hour.
Being shelled by the Japanese ships, the Port Arthur
forts replied as vigorously as they could, thus compelling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
Admiral Togo’s vessels to keep their distance.
In the meantime some of the Russian ships advanced
to the attack. These included the <em>Poltava</em>,
<em>Novik</em>, <em>Askold</em>, and <em>Diana</em>. All of them proved to
be no match for the alert Japanese, and each was so
badly damaged it had to return to the harbor as
speedily as possible. In this engagement the
Japanese lost no ships and less than sixty men killed
and wounded. What the losses were to the Russians
is not known, but they must have been heavy.</p>

<p>To Gilbert, who had spent so much of his time as
a soldier, the scene was a most absorbing one, and
with his field glasses to his eyes he took careful note
of every movement within sight. The booming of
the ships’ cannon came to him distinctly, as well as
the roar of the land batteries closer at hand.</p>

<p>Presently some sounds below him reached his ears,
and he knew that a number of persons had entered
the building and were talking excitedly among
themselves. He glanced over the edge of the tower
and saw that the courtyard below was filled with
Russian soldiers, who had just arrived in Port
Arthur, and were going to make the building their
temporary quarters.</p>

<p>“I wonder if they’ll try to stop me when I go
down,” Gilbert asked himself, and then, hearing
more firing from a land battery not far away, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
turned his attention once more to the battle. Shot
and shell were flying in all directions, and the air of
the harbor and the sea beyond hung heavy with
black smoke.</p>

<p>Just behind Gilbert was a small point of the tower,
built of rough stone. The young American was
just wondering if he could mount this and get a still
better view, when a strange noise close to his ear
caused him to drop his field glasses in a hurry.</p>

<p>“That was a shot as sure as fate!” he muttered.
“Perhaps I had better get out of here!”</p>

<p>For a moment he stood undecided, but then his
courage returned and he gazed once more at the
scene before him. A Japanese cruiser was pounding
one of the Russian ships at a lively rate and he
was unwilling to miss the exhibition.</p>

<p>Thinking to get a better view from another part
of the tower, Gilbert started to walk in that direction.
He had scarcely taken two steps when he
heard a crash overhead, and in a twinkling a mass of
stones and dirt came tumbling down around him.
A stray cannon ball had hit the point of the tower,
and the missile must have passed within a few feet
of the young American’s head.</p>
<br>

</figure>
<br>

<p>The stray shot was a most unexpected one, and
Gilbert cannot be blamed if he dodged and thought
of running away. Some of the stones hit him, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>the dirt filled his eyes, but he was not seriously
hurt.</p>

<p>“Reckon I had best get out of here,” he told himself,
and started to go below, when a voice from the
inside of the tower startled him.</p>

<p>“There is somebody up here,” came in Russian.
“That American they told us about!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br>
<span class="fs80">AN ESCAPE AND A FIGHT</span></h2>
</div>

<p>From the tone of the speaker Gilbert realized that
he had a rough individual with whom to deal. But
it was too late to back out or hide and he faced the
man boldly. He proved to be a corporal, and behind
him were several Russian privates, all in
heavy winter uniforms, for the day was stinging
cold.</p>

<p>“What are you doing up here?” demanded the
corporal.</p>

<p>“I was looking at the battle,” answered Gilbert.</p>

<p>“Who gave you permission to come in this
building?”</p>

<p>“Nobody, but as I found it wide open I thought
there would be no harm in coming in.”</p>

<p>The corporal muttered several words Gilbert did
not catch. Then he turned to the privates behind
him.</p>

<p>“See that this man does not get away,” he said.</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say that you are going to detain
me?” cried the young American. He did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
like the appearance of the Russians, or the black
looks they gave him.</p>

<p>“And why not? For all we know you may be a
spy,” and the corporal leered suspiciously at Gilbert.</p>

<p>“I am no spy.”</p>

<p>“Have you been making signals from this
tower?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Then why was that shot fired at you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know anything about that. If I was
signaling to the Japanese, do you think they’d fire
at me?”</p>

<p>“The shot may have come from one of our forts.
Come down at once.”</p>

<p>Evidently the Russian corporal was afraid another
shot might imperil his own safety, and he hustled
Gilbert down to the lower floor of the building without
ceremony. As soon as the American appeared
there was a cry of astonishment from all of the
soldiers.</p>

<p>“What is he doing here?”</p>

<p>“Is he the American who aided those Japanese?”</p>

<p>“Let us make an example of him! We want no
traitors in Port Arthur!”</p>

<p>So the talk ran on, and for the moment it looked
as if Gilbert would suffer bodily violence. But then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
a rather pleasant-looking Russian captain stalked
up, and pushed his men back.</p>

<p>“Not so fast, men,” he said, quietly but firmly.
“This American may mean no harm after all.”</p>

<p>“But it is known that he has helped the
Japanese,” said one.</p>

<p>“He was put out of his hotel for so doing,”
added another.</p>

<p>“I have heard he is a spy,” came from a third.</p>

<p>“I give you my word of honor, captain, that I am
not a spy,” said Gilbert, when he could get the
chance to speak.</p>

<p>“Who are you?”</p>

<p>“I am simply an American citizen, the selling
agent for the Richmond Importing Company. We
have been doing business here for several years.”</p>

<p>“I see.” The Russian captain mused for a
moment. “But it is true that you aided some
Japanese, yes?”</p>

<p>“I helped one man whom I knew personally. He
was being put out of his house after paying his rent.
I made the rent gatherer give the rent money back.
The man was poor, and he had a sick wife and
several small children depending upon him.”</p>

<p>“Ha! I see. Well, we have no further use for
the Japanese in this city, or in the whole of Manchuria,
for the matter of that. They must leave and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
at once. I will investigate your case more fully
later. In the meantime you must remain here.”</p>

<p>Gilbert’s heart sank and for the time being he
knew not how to reply. If he was made a prisoner
there was no telling when he would be able to clear
himself and get away. The Russian authorities
might keep him locked up for weeks and even
months. In the meanwhile, what would become of
the <em>Columbia</em> with her valuable cargo, and what
would become of his friends on board?</p>

<p>“They are not going to keep me a prisoner if I
can help it,” he told himself grimly. “I’ve been in
a tight fix before and got out of it, and I’ll get out
of this one too!”</p>

<p>The opportunity to escape came sooner than expected.
Scarcely a quarter of an hour went by when
there was a commotion on the street, and word was
brought in that all the Chinese and Japanese in Port
Arthur were rising, to massacre the Russian citizens.
The report was a false one, but it produced a terrible
sensation for a couple of hours, and the Russian
soldiers were called out to quell the disturbance.</p>

<p>In the excitement Gilbert watched his chance, and
when he was not observed, he slipped from among
the soldiers who surrounded him and through an
open doorway into another portion of the building.
From this apartment he ran into a near-by shed, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
then along a lane lined on either side by storehouses.</p>

<p>“Stop! stop!” he heard a Russian soldier yell,
and then several shots were fired after him, none of
which, however, took effect. He continued to run,
and coming to a wide open storehouse, ran inside,
mounted a ladder, and then laid down to hide behind
a number of sacks of salt.</p>

<p>The ex-lieutenant thought the Russian soldiers
would follow him, and such would undoubtedly
have been the case had it not been for the alarm just
mentioned. The alarm was close to the center of
the city, and the vicinity of the storehouse in which
he had hidden was all but deserted.</p>

<p>It must be admitted that the young American was
now in a most unsettled state of mind. What to do
next he did not know. He felt that he had gotten
himself into “hot water” in more ways than one.
Captain Barusky was against him, so were the
owner of the house in which Jiru Siko had resided,
and the officer from whom he had just made his
escape.</p>

<p>“They’ll prove me a spy, or worse, if they possibly
can,” he thought, and drew a deep sigh. “To
my way of thinking Port Arthur is getting too warm
to hold me. I reckon I had best clear out and come
back when this excitement is over. With this fighting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
going on, I’ll never be able to bring Ivan Snokoff
and Captain Barusky to justice.”</p>

<p>It was an easy matter to decide upon leaving Port
Arthur, but how the thing was to be done was
another matter. He knew that the railroad to the
north was closely guarded, and so was the entire
harbor front.</p>

<p>“If I had a good horse I might leave in the dark
and ride to Dalny, or Yang-tau-wo, or some other
place, and ship from there,” he reasoned. “Wonder
if I can buy a horse without attracting attention?”</p>

<p>Gilbert remained in the storehouse the best part of
two hours before he thought it safe to leave it.
Some soldiers had gone past and they did not return.
With caution he looked out of the doorway
and out of several windows to make certain that the
coast was clear.</p>

<p>The storehouse was in a portion of the city which
was new to him, and as he stepped out into the lane
once more he scarcely knew how to turn. But he
remembered the way he had come, and started in a
direction directly opposite.</p>

<p>A few minutes of rapid walking brought him to a
small square, on one side of which were more storehouses,
and on the other a number of drinking places,
and cheap lodging houses. Here were a number<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
of idle Russians, many the worse for liquor. To
avoid them Gilbert walked past as rapidly as he
could.</p>

<p>He had just reached the corner of a side street
when three half-drunken Russian stevedores hailed
him, and as he did not stop, two caught him by the
arm.</p>

<p>“Come and be cheerful!” cried one, in a thick
voice. “Don’t be afraid to spend your money.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, but I have no money to spare,”
answered Gilbert briefly, and attempted to pass
on.</p>

<p>“Ho! ho! just to hear the Englishman!” cried
the fellow. “For a truth I’m sure your pockets are
lined with <em>rubles</em>.”</p>

<p>“Or if not with <em>rubles</em> at least with <em>kopecks</em>,”
hiccoughed the second Russian. “Come, stranger,
let us drink to the success of Russia.”</p>

<p>“Aye!” put in a third. “The success of Russia,
and may every dog of a Nippon lose his life in this
war!”</p>

<p>The trio gathered closely around Gilbert, and one,
the dirtiest of the lot, almost embraced the ex-lieutenant.</p>

<p>“I tell you, I have nothing for you!” cried Gilbert
sharply. “Now let me pass.”</p>

<p>“What, will you not drink to the success of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
Russia and to the health of our Czar?” growled one
of the trio.</p>

<p>“I told you I had no money to spare. Now let
me pass,” and Gilbert tried to break away and pass
down the side street, for he saw that several other
Russians were approaching.</p>

<p>The breaking out of the war, and the battle in the
harbor, had made the Russian stevedores reckless,
and they thought they saw a chance to get some
money without working for it. At a sign from
their leader they set upon Gilbert and tripped him
up, so that he fell flat upon his back.</p>

<p>“Here, stop that!” he cried. “Stop it, I say!”
And when they did not stop, but instead made movements
as if to get at his watch and purse, he began
to struggle violently.</p>

<p>As my old readers will remember, Gilbert was
healthy and muscular, and it did not take him long
to struggle to his feet, and send one of his assailants
sprawling. Then he struck out once more, hitting
a second Russian on the nose.</p>

<p>“Knock him down!” spluttered that individual,
staggering back “Knock him down! Hit him
with a club.”</p>

<p>By this time two others of the stevedore gang
were at hand. One had a club and he made a
wicked pass for the young American’s head. Fortunately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
Gilbert saw the move, and dodged just in
time, so that the end of the stick merely grazed his
shoulder.</p>

<p>The fight was now growing hot, and Gilbert
backed up against a wall, hoping by this means to
keep his assailants in front of him. But now all
five of the Russians came at him, and he felt that
sooner or later he must become then victim.</p>

<p>“Help! help!” he cried. “Thieves! help!”</p>

<p>“Be quiet!” growled one of the Russians. “Be
quiet!”</p>

<p>“Hit him, Michael! Hit him, before he alarms
the whole neighborhood!” put in another.</p>

<p>The fellow called Michael advanced to do as
bidden. Gilbert warded off the blow once more, and
then sought to wrench the stick from the stevedore’s
grasp. In another instant the other Russians leaped
in, and down went the young American once more,
with all his enemies on top of him.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br>
<span class="fs80">AMONG JAPANESE FRIENDS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>For the moment it looked as if Gilbert would receive
the worst of the struggle. It was true that the
Russian stevedores were more than half intoxicated,
but they were five to one, and now they had Gilbert
flat on his back, and were both kicking and cuffing
him as hard as they could.</p>

<p>But at this critical moment an interruption came
which was as welcome to the young American as it
was unexpected. From a cellar door a short distance
away there issued half a dozen Japanese and
two Chinese, all armed with stout sticks. Looking
up and down the street, to make certain that
the coast was otherwise clear, they advanced
noiselessly and attacked the Russians from the
rear.</p>

<p>A howl of pain went up as one of the Russians
received a blow on the head that staggered him.
Then a second was hit on the ear, a third nearly had
his shoulder dislocated, and the others fared almost
as badly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>

<p>“The Japanese!” shrieked one of the stevedores.
“The Japanese!”</p>

<p>“Stop, do not kill us!” moaned a second.</p>

<p>Gilbert listened to the words in amazement.
Then he looked up, to behold Jiru Siko standing
there, stick in hand.</p>

<p>“Siko!” he cried. “This is fortunate!”</p>

<p>“Come, Master Pennington,” was the low answer.
“Make quick walk, no make quick walk
more Russians come—make much hurry!” And
he bent down and caught Gilbert by the arm.</p>

<p>The ex-lieutenant needed no second bidding, and
as quickly as he could he arose to his feet. The Japanese
took him by the arm and hurried him toward
the cellar stairs. In the meantime the others continued
to fight, and the Russian stevedores received
a sound thrashing. But now one blew a whistle, a
signal for the others of the gang to which he belonged.</p>

<p>Gilbert went down the cellar steps and Jiru Siko
and his friends came after him. Then the cellar
door was shut down and hooked fast. All was so
dark Gilbert could not for the moment see anything.</p>

<p>“Come, Jiru Siko show the way,” said the Japanese,
and hurried the young American forward
through the gloom. They passed across the cellar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
and into a passageway that was utterly black. All
the party followed a moment later, and Gilbert
heard a stout wooden door close and heard the bolts
as they were shot into place.</p>

<p>When the young American finally emerged from
the passageway he found himself covered with dust
and cobwebs. He was in a small stone room, almost
entirely underground. Overhead was a storehouse,
and beyond this the water front.</p>

<p>The room was filled with Japanese and Chinese,
and back of it was another room containing a number
of women and children, including Jiru Siko’s
family. It was a foul-smelling place, damp and
unwholesome, but to these conditions Gilbert did
not pay attention.</p>

<p>“I must thank you for coming to my assistance,”
said Gilbert, as he caught his Japanese friend by the
hand. “You came in the nick of time.”</p>

<p>“No forget what Master Pennington do for Jiru
Siko,” was the answer. “Very good man, Russians
very bad mans—like to fight Russians all time!”
And then the Japanese wanted to know if Gilbert
was seriously hurt.</p>

<p>“No hurts of any consequence,” said the young
American, after an inspection. “I got two or three
cracks I didn’t like, but that was all. But if you
hadn’t come up as you did, I don’t know how I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
should have fared. How did you happen to see
me?”</p>

<p>“Go out for something to eat,” was the reply.
The Japanese did not add that he and his followers
had intended to confiscate some goods in one of the
storehouses near there, yet such was a fact. All of
the party needed food, and, as the war had now
begun, they considered that a perfectly legitimate
way of getting what was wanted.</p>

<p>It was thought by some that the Russians would
try to get into the cellar and follow up those who
had attacked them. But when more of the stevedores
arrived those who had first set upon Gilbert
were too dazed to point out the way by which the
young American and his friends had escaped.</p>

<p>One of the Japanese had been left on guard, and
at length he came back with word that the Russians
had gone off to a neighboring drinking resort.</p>

<p>“But they say they will hunt out the American,”
said he. “And also hunt out us who aided him.
One of the Russians said the American must be a
leader among us and ought to be hung.”</p>

<p>This last bit of information was dismaying to
Gilbert. Like a flash he realized that his troubles
were growing deeper and deeper.</p>

<p>“First, it was Captain Barusky and that fellow
who had me put out of the hotel, then it was that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
officer who caught me on the tower, and now it is
the crowd who think I am a leader of these Japs,”
was what he told himself. “If they catch me, I
reckon they’ll do all they can to make me a Russian
prisoner of war.”</p>

<p>The Japanese and Chinese knew how Gilbert had
stood up for Jiru Siko and his family, and they told
him they would do all in their power for the young
American.</p>

<p>“I am afraid I’ll have to keep out of sight of the
Russian authorities for the present,” said the ex-lieutenant.
And he did what he could to explain
the situation. They listened with keen interest to
his story, and at the conclusion said, if he would
remain with them, they would do their utmost to
protect him.</p>

<p>“Got better room for American,” said one, and
after a consultation with Jiru Siko led the way
along another passageway and up a narrow and
dirty flight of stairs to a small apartment in the
rear of a Chinese furniture shop. The shop had
been closed ever since the first bombardment in the
harbor, and many of the goods had been carried
away.</p>

<p>The apartment was small but clean and had one
narrow window, overlooking some sheds which
lined the upper harbor entrance. Gilbert was told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
he could remain there as long ass he pleased, and the
Japanese and Chinese would see to it that he did
not suffer for the want of food.</p>

<p>The fighting in the harbor had now come to an
end, and only the occasional distant booming of a
cannon could be heard. Satisfied with sinking or
disabling the flower of the Russian navy located at
Port Arthur, Admiral Togo left the vicinity, fearful
that sooner or later the fire from the forts might
reach him. This fire had been incessant, but the aim
of the Russian gunners had been poor and but little
damage had been done.</p>

<p>Sitting down on a stool near the window, which
was tightly closed to keep out the cold air, Gilbert
gave himself up to his reflections. His mind was in
a tumult, and for some time he could scarcely
straighten out his thoughts.</p>

<p>The sudden breaking out of this war between
Russia and Japan had upset all his calculations.
He realized that it would be utterly useless for the
present to attempt to find Ivan Snokoff, or bring
that rascal and Captain Barusky to justice. He also
knew it would be useless to attempt to send any
message to Nagasaki or any other Japanese port,
or try to get a message from the <em>Columbia</em> and those
on board.</p>

<p>“The best thing I can do is to get out of Manchuria<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
just as quickly as possible,” was the conclusion
he reached. “These Russians feel sure I am
friendly to the Japanese, and that being so they’ll
handle me without gloves, if I let them catch me.
They are forcing me to become an enemy in self-defense.”</p>

<p>From the window Gilbert could see a distant body
of Russian soldiers marching through the streets,
on their way from the railroad station to their barracks.</p>

<p>“They must be expecting the Japanese to attack
them,” he thought. “Certainly they can’t be thinking
of sending an army to Japan.” His surmise
proved correct; and the attack came not long after,
as history has proved.</p>

<p>Towards the middle of the afternoon Jiru Siko
appeared, along with one of the Chinamen who
owned an interest in the furniture shop. They
brought with them something hot to eat and to
drink, for which Gilbert was thankful, for, as we
know, he had had nothing whatever since early
morning.</p>

<p>“Whole town fill up with Russian soldiers,”
announced Jiru Siko. “Soldiers in streets, soldiers
in houses, soldiers all over. No Japanese show
him face—make much trouble.”</p>

<p>“I reckon you’ll have to get out, Siko,” answered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
the young American. “But how you are going to
do it, I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“What Master Pennington going to do?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to get out, too—if I can. But I don’t
want to show myself to the Russians.”</p>

<p>“Want to sail on ship?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know of any other way to get out.
The Russians hold the railroad from end to
end.”</p>

<p>“No ship sail from Port Arthur—mean no Japanese
ship—big guns from fort smash bang!”</p>

<p>“I know that as well as you do.”</p>

<p>“Master Pennington want to go with Jiru
Siko?”</p>

<p>“Where to?”</p>

<p>“Nagasaki.”</p>

<p>“How are you going to get to Nagasaki?”</p>

<p>“Got big sailboat—sail in two, three days—when
weather is fine.”</p>

<p>“Not from here?”</p>

<p>“No! no! sailboat some miles from here. Go
away from Port Arthur in dark—walk or ride in
dark—come where boat is, wait for good time go
away. Master Pennington come, we do best we
can for him.”</p>

<p>“Jiru Siko, you are a true friend if ever there
was one!” ejaculated Gilbert, catching the brown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
hand of the little Japanese. “How soon do you expect
to start from here?”</p>

<p>“To-morrow night.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to get my traveling bag, if not my
trunk.”</p>

<p>The Japanese looked puzzled for a moment.</p>

<p>“Bad work get bag, Russians look for Master
Pennington at hotel—keep spy, get bag, catch quick,
maybe.”</p>

<p>“You mean they may have a spy watching for
my return?”</p>

<p>Jiru Siko nodded. “All city full of spies now,”
he added.</p>

<p>“I believe you. Nevertheless, I’ll see if I can’t
get the bag and a few other things. Herr Schaumberg
will do what he can for me, I know.”</p>

<p>The matter was talked over for a short while
longer, and then it was decided that Gilbert should
try to reach the German hotel as soon as it got
dark. He was to get back to the Chinese furniture
shop by the following evening, and then set out with
Jiru Siko and some others for the ship.</p>

<span class="fs80">AT THE GERMAN HOTEL</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Now that Gilbert was about to leave Port Arthur
he was anxious to see what he could of the preparations
for war, and when he left the furniture shop
at dark he did not move directly for Herr Schaumberg’s
hotel, but took a circuitous route which
brought him near to some of the forts.</p>

<p>That the Russians were doing all in their power
to render the port safe against an attack there could
be no doubt. Every fort was being strengthened,
and from the talk of some soldiers he learned that
some hills behind the town were likewise being fortified.</p>

<p>“They are afraid the Japs will land and come up
in the city’s rear,” he told himself, and this was the
truth. The work of fortifying Port Arthur went
on day and night for a long while, and great quantities
of stores were brought in, to use in case of
a siege.</p>

<p>By the time Gilbert reached the vicinity of the
German hotel it was long after dark. He did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
go to the front entrance, but took to an alleyway on
the left which led to some stables in the rear. This
brought him past a window of the private dining
room and there he saw Herr Schaumberg and his
wife and three children sitting at the table, partaking
of their evening meal.</p>

<p>The ex-lieutenant felt that he could trust the German,
but he was not so sure of Frau Schaumberg,
who, it will be remembered, was of Russian birth.
It was possible the lady had relatives in the Russian
army, and it would be a feather in their cap if the
American was caught by them.</p>

<p>The meal in the private dining room was about
over, and presently Gilbert saw the hotel keeper get
up and put on his hat. Then he came out of a side
door and walked towards the stables.</p>

<p>“Herr Schaumberg!” Gilbert called softly, and
hurried toward the man.</p>

<p>“Who vos it?” queried the hotel keeper, coming
to a halt, and peering into the darkness. “Vell, I
neffer! I dink you vos no comin’ pack no more,
Mr. Bennington.”</p>

<p>“What made you think that?”</p>

<p>“I hear dem say you vos a schpy. Dem Roossian
soldiers vos after you, not so?”</p>

<p>“I reckon they are after me, Herr Schaumberg.
But I have done no wrong.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span></p>

<p>“Den you vos hafe lots of droubles for noddings,
hey?”</p>

<p>“That’s the size of it. But I haven’t time to
talk. I want my bag and some other things, and I
want to pay you. Will it be safe for me to go to
my room?”</p>

<p>“I dink me not—chust yet. You see, mine <em>frau</em>
she vos a Roossian, an’ she ton’t like you mooch on
dat account.”</p>

<p>“I suspected as much.”</p>

<p>“You come py der stable. I vill tell you ven you
can come into der hotel,” went on Herr Schaumberg.</p>

<p>In a minute more Gilbert was in the stable, and
sitting in a room used for storing harness. The
grooms were gone, so there was no danger from
that source.</p>

<p>“Now I go pack to der hotel,” said Herr
Schaumberg, after he had looked to see if the horses
had been properly cared for for the night. “Chust
you vait here bis I come again, hey?”</p>

<p>“How long will I have to wait?”</p>

<p>“Besser vait bis mine <em>frau</em> she go to ped. Dat is
apout an hour.”</p>

<p>“Very well, I’ll wait.”</p>

<p>While he was left to himself, Gilbert pondered
over what he should take along and what was to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
left behind. He could not be too heavily burdened,
for the journey to the ship might be a hard one, and
Jiru Siko had told him that nobody was to carry
much baggage. Scarcely an hour had gone by when
the hotel keeper returned.</p>

<p>“Mine <em>frau</em> she vos sleepy,” said he with a good-natured
grin. “I told her besser go py der ped an’
she go. Come now, an’ don’t make so mooch noise
like a fly.”</p>

<p>He went on ahead, out of the stable, across a
small courtyard, and into the hotel by a back door.
Gilbert had hold of his arm, and made no noise
whatever, since his shoes were protected by heavy
winter rubbers. They passed up a dark stairway
and through the upper hall.</p>

<p>“Here vos your room,” said the hotel proprietor.
“Shall I vait for you or come pack?”</p>

<p>“You can wait if you wish—I’ll not be long,”
answered the ex-lieutenant.</p>

<p>A light was lit, and Gilbert brought forth his
trunk and his traveling bag. Having decided what
to take and what to leave behind, it was an easy
matter to pack the bag, and inside of fifteen minutes
the task was done. Then Gilbert settled his bill.</p>

<p>“I’ll have to leave the trunk here,” said he.
“Will you take care of it until you hear from me
again?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span></p>

<p>“Mit bleasure, Mr. Bennington. I vos sorry you
haf to git owid like dis.”</p>

<p>“It is not my fault. The Russians are treating
me very unjustly.” Gilbert shut his teeth hard.
“I’ve got a score to settle with them for it.”</p>

<p>“I ton’t vos plame you. Put I can’t say noddings.
Of I do, I got me into droubles, hey?”</p>

<p>“I reckon so.” Gilbert Paused and glanced
around the room. “I may as well be going now.
Good-by, and much obliged for what you have done
for me.”</p>

<p>The light was put out, and the pair passed again
into the dark hallway, Herr Schaumberg having
left the lights unlit on purpose. Gilbert now carried
his bag, which was by no means light in weight.</p>

<p>The back stairs were just gained, when there came
sounds from the main room of the hotel. Some new
arrival had just come in. Leaving Gilbert, Herr
Schaumberg ran to the front stairway, and glanced
down to the floor below.</p>

<p>“Dere vos some Roossian soldiers dare!” he
whispered, as he came running back. “You vos
besser get owid kvick!”</p>

<p>“I will,” answered Gilbert. “Good-by. Don’t
say anything about me.” And in another instant
he was descending the back stairs two steps at a
time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span></p>

<p>All might have gone well with the ex-lieutenant
had not something occurred upon which neither he
nor Herr Schaumberg had calculated. Sneaking
into the back door of the hotel at that moment was
one of the servants, who had gone out for a walk
unknown to her master or mistress.</p>

<p>As Gilbert landed at the foot of the stairs he came
upon the girl with a suddenness that sent her flying
against a kitchen door. The breath was almost
knocked out of her, yet she immediately let out a
yell of terror.</p>

<p>“Help! help!” she screamed in German. “Help!
Who is this? A robber!”</p>

<p>“Excuse me,” murmured Gilbert. “Sorry, but
I didn’t see you,” and, slipping past the girl, he
opened the door into the courtyard.</p>

<p>“A robber! A robber!” shrieked the girl, and
continued to cry out until she had aroused the whole
household. All came running to the spot, and with
them the Russian soldiers that had just arrived.</p>

<p>“Vot is it, Bena?” questioned Herr Schaumberg,
although he knew only too well.</p>

<p>“A robber!” wailed the girl. “He knocked me
down! He wanted to murder me!”</p>

<p>“I saw nobody,” answered the hotel keeper.
“You must be mistaken.” He was now addressing
the girl in German.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span></p>

<p>“No, no, I saw him, Herr Schaumberg, indeed
I did!”</p>

<p>“How did he look?” The hotel keeper thought
to gain time for Gilbert by asking a number of
questions.</p>

<p>“I could not see very well, it was so dark.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it was Frederick the stableman.”</p>

<p>“No, it was a stranger, and he carried a hand-bag.”</p>

<p>“And are you sure you are not dreaming?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am sure. I saw him with my two eyes.
Oh, how he scared me. I shall never get over it,
never!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it was that good-for-nothing American,”
came from Frau Schaumberg, who had just
come from her room. “Run to his room and see
if his things are still there.”</p>

<p>Now this was just what her husband did not
wish, but he did not dare to say so.</p>

<p>“Very well, we will look,” said he. “Where is
the key?”</p>

<p>“I have it not, Carl. Perhaps it is in the
office.”</p>

<p>“Or he took it with him,” answered the hotel
keeper, who had the key in his pocket. “Wait till
I look.”</p>

<p>He hurried to the office, dropping the key in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
the hall on the way. His wife came after him, followed
by the frightened servant.</p>

<p>“I see no key here,” said Herr Schaumberg, after
looking around.</p>

<p>“Better break down the door of the room,” put
in one of the soldiers. “We came in to look for
that fellow.”</p>

<p>“Very well, we can do that,” said the hotel
keeper. “But wait till I make a light.”</p>

<p>The hall was lit up, and then the hotel keeper, not
wishing to have the door injured, pretended to
stumble over the key.</p>

<p>“Here it is!” he cried.</p>

<p>“Ha! the fellow must have thrown it there!”
cried Frau Schaumberg, in triumph. “Now look
into the room at once!”</p>

<p>The door was thrown open and all crowded into
the apartment. The trunk was in a corner, locked
and strapped.</p>

<p>“The bag is gone!” shrieked the lady of the
house. “He has been here, beyond any question!
He it was who knocked Bena down! Oh, the rascal!
the robber! And to think we thought he was such
a fine gentleman!”</p>

<p>“He appeared to be all right,” said the hotel
keeper slowly.</p>

<p>“I distrusted him from the start,” sniffed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
wife. She turned to the soldiers. “What shall
you do now?”</p>

<p>“We’ll go after him,” declared the corporal who
was in command. “Take good care that he does
not come back and get that trunk,” he added
grimly.</p>

<p>“You will take charge of it later?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you had better look around the room
first,” interposed Herr Schaumberg. “You may
get some clew to where he is going.”</p>

<p>The hotel keeper knew well enough that Gilbert
had left no clew behind him, but, as said before, he
wanted to give the young American all the time
possible in which to make good his escape. Gilbert’s
frank manner had pleased him from the start, and,
for reasons of his own, he bore no good feeling
towards the soldiers of the Czar.</p>

<p>The suggestion to search the room was carried
out, but nothing of importance was found, even in
the trunk, which was smashed open with a
hatchet.</p>

<p>“It’s no use wasting time here,” said the corporal
at last. “Come, the quicker we get on his trail the
better.”</p>

<p>“Yes! yes!” came from Frau Schaumberg.
“And I trust with ah my heart you capture him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, we are sure to do that, sooner or later.
Every road out of Port Arthur is guarded, so he
cannot get away from the city. If we don’t locate
him anywhere else, we’ll probably root him out from
some nest of Japanese or Chinese.”</p>

<span class="fs80">GILBERT LEAVES PORT ARTHUR</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Once in the courtyard of the German hotel,
Gilbert did not stop to consider the situation. He
knew that the Russian soldiers were in front of the
place, and his only chance of safety lay in flight to
the rear.</p>

<p>Running as rapidly as he could with the satchel,
which was tightly packed and heavy, he passed to
one side of the stables, and entered a small alleyway
leading to a back street. The alleyway was littered
with rubbish, and he went down twice, tearing
his clothing in several places, and scratching his left
hand.</p>

<p>“This is certainly no picnic,” he muttered, as he
picked himself up for the second time. “But they
shan’t catch me—not if I know it!”</p>

<p>He had the “lay of the land” fairly well in his
head, and tried to take as straight a course as possible
for the Chinese furniture shop. But this was
not easy, for many streets in Port Arthur are
crooked and end in unexpected places. More than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
this, he had to be on a constant lookout for more
of the Russian soldiery.</p>

<p>Presently he reached a street that was apparently
deserted, all of the residents having gone to bed.
Being now almost out of wind, he dropped into a
walk.</p>

<p>“I reckon I’ve thrown them off the track,” he
told himself, and then, coming to the dark entrance
to a shop, set his bag down to rest for a few minutes.</p>

<p>All was quiet in the city. Thanks to the delay
occasioned by Herr Schaumberg, the Russians who
had visited the German hotel had failed to get on
the young American’s track.</p>

<p>Having gotten back his wind, Gilbert picked up
his bag once again. As he did this, a burly form
loomed up out of the semi-darkness around a corner.</p>

<p>“Ho there! Stop!” came in the voice of a Russian
policeman. And he strode toward Gilbert,
club in hand.</p>

<p>Gilbert felt that it would be useless to run, for
the policeman would surely shoot at him. At once
he resolved to play a trick on the officer of the
law.</p>

<p>“Thank goodness you have arrived,” he gasped.
“Can you catch them?”</p>

<p>“Catch them?” queried the policeman. “Who?”</p>

<p>“The men who were following me. See, there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
they go, the rascals! I might have lost my bag
and my money.”</p>

<p>“Were they Chinese?”</p>

<p>“They must have been—it was almost too dark
to see. There’s another of them!”</p>

<p>Gilbert pointed to a distant corner with his hand
and sank down as if exhausted. The policeman
stared at him for an instant.</p>

<p>“I’ll see what I can do,” said the officer of the
law, as he drew his pistol. “Stay here till I return,”
and off he went on a run.</p>

<p>The moment the officer had turned the corner the
ex-lieutenant started on a dead run in the opposite
direction. Having rested, he was able to make
fairly good time, and soon put four squares between
himself and the policeman. Then he dropped
once again into a walk, but now kept a sharp lookout
on all sides for the possible appearance of another
enemy.</p>

<p>Before he reached the Chinese quarter of the
town he heard a tramping at a distance. More soldiers
had arrived, including some Cossack cavalry,
who went clattering loudly over the pavements.</p>

<p>“So you get back, no trouble,” said Jiru Siko,
when he appeared. “Much glad to see dat,” and
the face of the little brown man showed his sincerity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span></p>

<p>“But I had a whole lot of trouble,” answered
Gilbert, and told his story. “Port Arthur is altogether
too hot to hold me much longer.”</p>

<p>“Very bad—bad for American—bad for poor
son of Nippon,” was the reply. “Glad to go
soon.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll be glad to get out myself. But we’ll
have to be very careful, Siko.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes; go like mice—the Russian cat can’t
catch him!” And the Japanese smiled knowingly.</p>

<p>“Are you going to take your wife and children
along?”</p>

<p>“Wife and chillen go already—Russians no stop
women. They meet Jiru Siko on boat—other women,
too—men go, you and me, altogether.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad we won’t have the women and children
along. It’s going to be no easy matter to get
out of the city.”</p>

<p>“I show Master Pennington trick—you watch.
Now go sleep—no sleep next night—go on boat,
maybe fight.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m tired enough to go to sleep,” answered
Gilbert, and in less than half an hour he was
in the land of dreams, despite the dangers which
surrounded him.</p>

<p>When Gilbert awoke it was broad daylight.
Looking out of the window he saw that a light snow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
was falling, which a keen, penetrating wind was
blowing in several directions.</p>

<p>“This won’t make traveling very pleasant,” he
thought. “But it may make it easier for us to escape.”</p>

<p>By looking at his watch he found it was after ten
o’clock, showing that he had slept much longer
than usual. Getting up, he found himself as fresh
as ever and tremendously hungry. He was glad
to see one of the Chinamen come in with some fresh
bread, coffee, and a couple of deliciously cooked
chops.</p>

<p>“See here, John, I want to pay you for these,”
said he, and insisted upon giving the Celestial a
<em>ruble</em>, for which the fellow was extremely grateful.
The Chinese in Port Arthur had never fared well
under Russian rule, and now their situation was
worse than ever, for the followers of the Czar knew
they would do all in their power to help the Japanese.</p>

<p>From the Chinaman Gilbert learned that Jiru
Siko had gone off to make arrangements for leaving
Port Arthur, and would not be back much before
nightfall. There was nothing to do but to wait, and
the young American made himself as comfortable
as possible in the meantime.</p>

<p>It was after six o’clock when the Japanese returned,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
and at once he and his companions held a
long conference. Then he came to Gilbert.</p>

<p>“Go now,” said he. “You got pistol?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” was the answer, and the ex-lieutenant
produced the weapon, loaded and ready for use. It
had been his companion during the campaign
in China, and he knew he could depend upon
it.</p>

<p>“No shoot quick,” went on Jiru Siko. “Shoot
only when can’t help.”</p>

<p>“I understand, and I don’t want to shoot anybody
if it can be avoided,” returned Gilbert.</p>

<p>The snow was coming down thickly, and the wind
was blowing strongly when Gilbert and eight others
of the party left the furniture shop. At the same
time another party of seven left the quarters under
the storehouse, but they went off in another direction.</p>

<p>The course was through a dirty, narrow street of
the Chinese quarter, and then to a row of stables,
where stood a number of carts piled high with boxes
and intrenching tools.</p>

<p>“Hide in the carts,” explained Jiru Siko. “Carts
go out of city to-night, sure. Be careful, no
noise.”</p>

<p>He went with the young American, and in a few
minutes both were secreted in one of the carts, between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
two packing cases loaded with ammunition.
On top of them were a number of shovels and picks
and over the whole a rough tarpaulin, to keep off
the snow.</p>

<p>Once hidden in the carts, none of the party dared
to speak excepting in the faintest of whispers. All
waited patiently for about half an hour, when several
Russian cart-drivers and hostlers appeared,
bringing with them a number of horses. The men
were talking in a boisterous manner, and were
evidently dissatisfied with the task before
them.</p>

<p>“We could wait until daylight just as well,”
grumbled one. “To drive out in such a snowstorm
and on such a road is not pleasant.”</p>

<p>“True, Pasof but orders are orders,” came from
a second. “And the sooner we arrive at Chic-yang
the better for us. So hurry along.”</p>

<p>The horses were soon hooked fast to the carts,
and then, mounting the seats, the drivers started up
their teams with loud cracks of their whips and
curses long and deep.</p>

<p>At the first jounce over the rough pavements Gilbert
felt that the ride was to be anything but pleasant.
But that shaking up was as nothing to what
followed, and he had to brace himself between the
boxes with all his strength to prevent some bones<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
from being crushed. Up and down went the cart,
in and out of holes and ruts, the snow sifting in at
times and down the young American’s neck, in spite
of the fact that he had buttoned his coat tightly
around him. It was intensely cold, and soon his
feet seemed to be more than half-frozen.</p>

<p>“How much of this have we got to stand?” he
whispered to his companion.</p>

<p>“Not much—soon we leave city we leave cart,”
was Jiru Siko’s answer. He was suffering as much
as Gilbert, but uttered no complaint.</p>

<p>A moment later the cart went into a hole with a
jounce that threatened to break an axle. Part of
the load began to slip back, and in alarm the driver
leaped down to readjust it.</p>

<p>The movement brought the man close to Gilbert’s
hiding-place, and as the end of the tarpaulin was
raised the ex-lieutenant felt almost certain that he
would be discovered.</p>

<p>But the discovery did not come, and having
shoved two of the cases back into place, and readjusted
several ropes which bound them, the driver
moved on once more.</p>

<p>That jounce proved the last, and soon after this
the cart struck a hard and fairly smooth dirt road,
where riding for those in hiding was much
easier.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span></p>

<p>“We out of Port Arthur now,” whispered Jiru
Siko. “Leave cart soon.”</p>

<p>“What about the others?”</p>

<p>“They leave, too—all go to old house on road to
water.”</p>

<p>After this nothing was said for fully ten minutes.
The cart was now moving along at a fair rate of
speed, and the driver was puffing away contentedly
at a short pipe between his teeth, and paying scant
attention to the load behind.</p>

<p>“Now we go,” whispered Jiru Siko, and worked
his way noiselessly to the rear of the cart. Gilbert
went with him, and in a moment more both dropped
into the road. Then, hand in hand, they ran out
of sight in the darkness, and the cart rumbled on,
the driver never once suspecting that he had been
carrying passengers.</p>

<p>The house the Japanese had in mind was a good
half mile away. The road lay over a barren field,
now covered with several inches of snow.</p>

<p>“It is certainly cold to-night,” said Gilbert, when
he felt at liberty to speak. “We’ll have no fun of it
when we reach the water front.”</p>

<p>“Cold make Russians stay in by fire,” answered
his companion. “No see us—so better for
boat.”</p>

<p>“That is true, but—— What does that mean?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span></p>

<p>Gilbert broke off short as a pistol shot rang out
at a distance. Then came a yell in Russian, followed
by a cry of alarm in Japanese.</p>

<p>“Somebody found out!” cried Jiru Siko.
“Come, we must run now, or get caught sure!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X<br>
<span class="fs80">AT SEA IN A SNOW SQUALL</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The Japanese was right, two of the party in another
cart had been discovered just at the moment
they were leaving the turnout. In alarm the Russian
driver ordered them to stop, and then called
to another cart-driver for assistance.</p>

<p>The cry uttered by the Japanese was given in
order to warn their friends. Now they came rushing
across the field, closely followed by others of the
party. On the road the Russians continued to give
the alarm, and an instant later several shots were
fired, one striking a Japanese in the arm. The fellow
wanted to open fire in return, but Jiru Siko told him
he had better not, as that would only add to the
excitement and call forward more of the Russians.</p>

<p>With his heavy bag Gilbert had all he could do
to keep up with the Japanese, although several of
them carried loads fully as heavy as, if not heavier
than, his own. The little brown men seemed to be
all bone and muscle, and sprinted over the snow-covered
ground in a manner that was wonderful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span></p>

<p>Lights were now flashing forth from several directions,
and soon came a shot from a distant sentry,
answered by a similar shot from another sentry.
The location of these shots was carefully noted by
both Jiru Siko and Gilbert.</p>

<p>“This is the road between,” said the ex-lieutenant,
and the Japanese nodded, to show that he
agreed. The way led past the house Jiru Siko had
in mind to visit, and there they were joined by all
of the others who had left Port Arthur but a short
while before.</p>

<p>Not far from the house was a patch of dwarfed
timber and into this the Japanese and Gilbert dashed.
One of the number appeared to be familiar with
the ground and he led the way, the others following
in single file. They went over a small hill and
across a pond covered with ice and snow, where two
slipped and went flat on their backs. Then they
mounted some rocks, swept clear of the snow by
the wind, and came out on a road which followed
the seacoast.</p>

<p>By this time the whole party had been running an
hour, and it must be confessed that Gilbert was beginning
to lose his wind. But the Japanese kept on
without slacking their pace, and there was nothing
for him to do but to keep up or be left behind.</p>

<p>“Those fellows are wonderful runners,” he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
thought, and then he remembered how the Japanese
soldiers had pressed forward when the cry was,
“On to Pekin!” He felt certain that if the Japanese
army ever landed in Manchuria, they would
give the Russians some hard marching and fighting.
How true this surmise proved we shall see later.</p>

<p>It was nearly four in the morning when the party
reached a spot where there was a sandy beach with
a small inlet. Here was a rude boathouse, which
was apparently deserted.</p>

<p>As they came up to the boathouse Jiru Siko drew
from his clothing two small rockets. Sticking one
in the snow he set it off and then gazed anxiously
out to sea, his companions doing likewise.</p>

<p>A few minutes passed, and then, through the
swirling snow, they saw the flare of an answering
rocket. At once all ran along the beach and leaped
into two rowboats lying there.</p>

<p>It was a hazardous thing to do, for the seacoast
was lined with floating cakes of ice. But the Japanese
did not hesitate, nor did Gilbert, for all felt
that the alarm on the road would speedily lead to
an investigation, and the trail through the snow was
a fairly plain one. The young American seized an
oar with the rest and pulled as sturdily as anybody.</p>

<p>At last the two rowboats were well away from
the shore, and then those on board began to search<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
once more for the ship whence the answering rocket
had been seen. They saw a light behind them and
knew that the Russians were already on the trail.</p>

<p>A half-hour passed, and in the whirling snow it
looked as if they had missed the ship entirely and
would be at the mercy of the elements. Gilbert was
fearfully cold, and so worn out with running and
rowing that he could scarcely sit up.</p>

<p>Seeing that there was no help for it, Jiru Siko
lit his second rocket. Hardly had it gone up into
the air when a gun boomed out, and a solid shot
went whistling over their heads.</p>

<p>“If we are struck we’ll go to the bottom sure,”
thought Gilbert, and gave a shiver, for the thought
of such an icy grave was not a pleasant one.</p>

<p>The first shot was followed by a second, and then
a third. But these flew still further away, and then
all aboard the small boats breathed easier.</p>

<p>At last came a shout, which was quickly answered
by the Japanese. They saw the light of several lanterns,
and waved a small light in return. Then there
loomed up in the darkness the form of a fair-sized
Japanese sailing craft, with several sails set. These
were speedily lowered and in a moment more the
two rowboats drew alongside.</p>

<p>There was some danger of the rowboats being
swamped, for the sea was running strongly. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
with the aid of the sailors on the larger craft all in
the rowboats were transferred to the deck of the
big vessel. Then one of the rowboats was also
taken aboard, and the other cast adrift, and the
sailing ship proceeded on her course to the southeast.</p>

<p>The Japanese ship was named the <em>O-Taka</em>, which
means <em>The Hawk</em>. She was a fairly comfortable
vessel, broad of beam, and with sailing qualities
better than ordinary. Her captain, a keen-eyed
Japanese named Toyano, had served in the war between
Japan and China years before, and had an
abnormal hatred of the Russians. He knew that he
was in dangerous waters, but laughed to scorn the
anxiety of the sailors under him.</p>

<p>“We can show them a clear stern,” said he, in his
native tongue. “And if a steamship comes close
we can give them a taste of a sailor’s muscle and
shooting qualities.”</p>

<p>On board of the <em>O-Taka</em> were Jiru Siko’s family
and also the families of several other Japanese refugees.
The women and smaller children were
crowded into the cabin of the ship, while their belongings
were either thrown into the hold or lashed
fast in a heap on the deck. Everybody on board
was Japanese but Gilbert, and many gazed curiously
at the young American. He was introduced to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
captain, who told him to make himself at home as
best he could.</p>

<p>“You will have to rough it with us,” said he. “I
can offer you no stateroom, since those are given to
the women and children. And should we fall afoul
of a Russian warship all of us will have to take
what comes.”</p>

<p>“I’ve roughed it many times before,” answered
Gilbert, with a quiet smile. “As a soldier I served
in Cuba, Luzon, and in China.”</p>

<p>“Good! Then you are no stranger to war. I
am glad to meet you,” and Captain Toyano shook
hands once more. “Jiru Siko tells me they took
you for a spy in Port Arthur.”</p>

<p>“They did, and I am running away now to escape
being put into a Russian prison just for nothing
at all!”</p>

<p>“In that case you must sympathize with us Japanese?”
And the captain bent a penetrating glance
upon the ex-lieutenant.</p>

<p>“I certainly do not sympathize with the Russians,”
returned Gilbert bluntly. “They have
caused me a good lot of trouble, and now it looks
as if I, or rather the company I represent, was going
to lose a lot of money through them.” And
here Gilbert told as much of his tale as he thought
the ship’s commander would care to hear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span></p>

<p>As soon as those who were in the rowboats were
taken on board every light on the deck was extinguished
and a little later all of the sails were hoisted.
Running in such absolute darkness was dangerous,
but no more so than to show a light and thus
invite a shot from one of the forts or from a Russian
man-o’-war. Two men were kept at the bow,
each doing his best to see what was ahead, and thus
give warning of danger, should any appear.</p>

<p>By daybreak the snowstorm was over, and at ten
o’clock in the morning the sun came out brightly,
making it much warmer than it had been. The
<em>O-Taka</em> was now out of sight of land, and steering
a straight course for the southern extremity of
Korea and for Nagasaki, about two hundred miles
beyond. The wind was favorable, and with every
sail set the vessel plowed through the waters of
the Yellow Sea with surprising swiftness.</p>

<p>Roughly estimated, the sailing distance from Port
Arthur to Nagasaki is almost seven hundred miles,
the route being past the Shan-tung Promontory and
Quelpart Island. Of course, much depends upon the
winds, which are highly variable in these quarters,
but the captain of the <em>O-Taka</em> expected to make the
trip inside of a week, unless the weather proved
unusually foul.</p>

<p>The one anxiety on board was concerning provisions.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
It had been impossible to procure anything
in the shape of meat or vegetables, and the quantity
of rice, flour, and salt fish was limited, as was also
the quantity of drinking water. Everybody was
put on short rations from the start. At this the
Japanese refugees did not grumble, being satisfied
to get away from their enemy at any cost, and Gilbert
had sense enough likewise to remain silent.</p>

<p>With all their hardships the Japanese were a
cheerful lot, and frequently beguiled the time by
singing, and by playing on several stringed instruments
which had been brought along. One comic
song of the day, called “The Man Who Sailed on a
Whale,” was a great favorite, especially with the
children. The national songs were also sung, the
sailors joining in the refrains with a will.</p>

<p>Three days passed, and only some distant sails
were sighted, none of which attempted to draw near
them. Once the lookout detected a great smoke to
the northeast, and this smoke was thought to come
from the funnels of Russian warships. At once the
course was changed due south, and soon the smoke
was left behind.</p>

<p>So far since the snowstorm the weather had been
fine, but on the night of the third day the atmosphere
grew heavy, and by midnight the snow was
coming down once more in heavy flakes, which all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
but obliterated the view on all sides of the ship.
The lookouts were doubled, and as the wind increased,
the sails were slightly trimmed.</p>

<p>“This is not so pleasant,” said Gilbert to Jiru
Siko, as both turned out in the morning.</p>

<p>“One must take the copper with the silver,” responded
the Japanese. “Lucky to get away from
Russians—sink ship, what we do den, you say?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know that I can say anything,” laughed
the young American. “More than likely we’d go
to Davy Jones’s locker.”</p>

<p>“What locker dat? I don’t know him,” and the
little brown man looked puzzled.</p>

<p>“I mean the bottom of the sea. American sailors
call it Davy Jones’s locker.”</p>

<p>“Ah! Dat so, him Davy Jones got mighty big
locker—all same full whales and many fish,” and
Jiru Siko laughed at his little joke, and Gilbert
laughed with him.</p>

<p>Breakfast had been served, and Gilbert was strolling
toward the bow of the ship when one of the
lookouts gave a sudden cry:</p>

<p>“A ship! A ship!”</p>

<p>He was right, and a second later a big warship
loomed up directly in front of the sailboat. The warship
was coming forward at a good rate of speed,
sending the spray flying in all directions.</p>
<br>

<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span></p>

<p>“We’ll be run down!” cried Gilbert, and this
cry was taken up on all sides. Then came a cry
from the big ship, and they heard the churning of
the water as the engines were reversed. But the
forward movement of the warship was scarcely
slackened, and it looked as if in a moment more
there would be a collision, and the sailboat would be
sunk.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI<br>
<span class="fs80">AN ORDER TO LAY-TO</span></h2>
</div>

<p>As the big warship came nearer and nearer those
on board of the sailboat increased their cries. But
the large vessel was doing all in her power to back
water, and could do no more. She had been running
at her highest rate of speed and her headway
was therefore tremendous.</p>

<p>The only thoroughly cool men on the <em>O-Taka</em> were
the captain and the steersman, the latter a salt of
many years’ experience. The former issued orders
with rapidity, and the steersman obeyed “on the
jump.” Then the sailors were ordered to shift one
of the sails, and just as the warship was almost upon
them, the sailboat sheered off sharply to one side;
and the danger was over.</p>

<p>“Well, that was a close shave!” muttered Gilbert.
“A little closer and we would have been cut
in two as if by a knife!”</p>

<p>For several minutes the sailboat continued to rock
in the swells created by the larger vessel. In the
midst of this came an order through a megaphone
to lay-to.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span></p>

<p>At first sight of the warship all on board of the
<em>O-Taka</em> wondered if she was not Russian, in which
case it would have fared badly with Captain Toyano
and all with him. But now it was seen that it
was one attached to the Japanese navy, and was carrying
a number of soldiers as well as sailors.</p>

<p>“What ship?” was asked in Japanese.</p>

<p>“The <em>O-Taka</em>, from Nagasaki,” replied Captain
Toyano, making a trumpet of his hands.</p>

<p>“Did you come from that port last?”</p>

<p>“No, we came from Port Arthur.”</p>

<p>“Continue to lay-to until we inspect you,” was
the short and sharp command.</p>

<p>“I will do so.”</p>

<p>No more was said, and in a few minutes a boat
was lowered at the side of the warship and an under-officer
entered with eight sailors. In ten minutes
the officer was on the deck of the <em>O-Taka</em>, and Captain
Toyano greeted him cordially.</p>

<p>“Inspect as you will,” said the captain. And
then he told how he had come to pick up those on
board and of the escape from the Russians at Port
Arthur.</p>

<p>“You were fortunate to get away,” said the Japanese
naval officer. “One good shot would have
sunk you instantly.” He gazed at Gilbert. “Who
is this Englishman?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span></p>

<p>“He is an American, a representative of an importing
company that was doing business in Manchuria.
He wanted to get away, and so we took
him along.”</p>

<p>“He is not a spy?”</p>

<p>“I am sure he is not. But you can question him,
if you wish.”</p>

<p>“I will.”</p>

<p>Gilbert was called up, and the naval officer put
half a dozen pointed questions to him, all of which
he answered satisfactorily.</p>

<p>“You consider yourself a non-combatant?” said
the officer, at last.</p>

<p>“For the present, yes, but I’m half of a mind to
throw in my fortunes with Japan.”</p>

<p>“Indeed. Do you think you would like to
fight?”</p>

<p>“Yes, under certain circumstances. I’ve done
my share of it. I served in Cuba, Luzon, and at the
Boxer uprising in China, first as a volunteer, and
then as a lieutenant of the regulars.”</p>

<p>“Is it possible! I am pleased to meet you, Lieutenant
Pennington.” The naval officer shook hands.
“We have quite a number of Americans in our
army and navy.”</p>

<p>“I knew you had some of our gunners on your
ships.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span></p>

<p>“Yes—more than perhaps you imagine—they
flocked in as soon as they heard war was expected.”</p>

<p>“Well, if I ever fight again, it will be as a soldier.
I prefer the land.”</p>

<p>“Well, we need soldiers. We are already landing
troops in Korea to march against the Russians
at the north.” And here the conversation came to
a close. Soon the under-officer left and the <em>O-Taka</em>
was permitted to proceed once more on her course,
while the warship put on full steam and soon disappeared
in the swirling snow.</p>

<p>What the under-officer had said about landing
troops in Korea was true, and while the <em>O-Taka</em> is
speeding on her way we will take a brief glance
backward, and see how the first shot in this
great war between Russia and Japan came to be
fired.</p>

<p>On the west coast of Korea is the harbor and town
of Chemulpo, a place of considerable importance,
with a valuable shipping interest. About the time
when negotiations at St. Petersburg were broken off
there were in the harbor two Russian warships, a
fine protected cruiser of 6500 tons, named the
<em>Varyag</em>, and an old-style gunboat, called the <em>Korietz</em>,
of use mainly for coast defense.</p>

<p>On the eighth of February a Russian boat carrying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
army and navy stores arrived at Chemulpo and
reported having sighted a number of warships at
a distance. The ships were supposed to be Japanese,
and to make certain the commander of the
<em>Korietz</em> went out to reconnoiter. The approaching
ships proved to be a Japanese squadron under
command of Admiral Uriu. The squadron consisted
of a battleship, four cruisers, and seven torpedo
boats, all of which were acting as a convoy to a
number of transports carrying twenty-five hundred
Japanese soldiers.</p>

<p>At the sight of the enemy the old <em>Korietz</em> was
cleared for action, and a gun fired—whether as a
signal to lay-to, or as an opening shot of war, is not
definitely settled. But be that as it may, the shot was
immediately answered by the Japanese, who discharged
two torpedoes at the presumptuous old gunboat.
Seeing this, the <em>Korietz</em> lost no time in returning
to the protection of Chemulpo harbor.</p>

<p>Night was now coming on, and under cover of
the darkness the Japanese transports succeeded in
making a landing, and all of the Japanese soldiers
went ashore. As soon as they were in a position to
resist a possible attack, the Japanese squadron
steamed out to sea.</p>

<p>It is possible that those on the Russian warships
thought they would be free of their enemy, but early<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
in the morning came a communication from Admiral
Uriu, stating that war between the two nations
had been declared, and that the Russian ships must
either come out on the high seas and fight or be
attacked where they lay in the harbor.</p>

<p>“Weak as we are, we will go out and fight them,”
said the Russian commander, who must be admired
for his great bravery, and not long after this the
<em>Varyag</em> steamed out, followed by the old <em>Korietz</em>.
Those on board knew that they were going almost to
certain doom, yet they put on a brave front, the
band playing church hymns and the national anthem,
and the jackies singing lustily.</p>

<p>With such an advantage on one side the fight
could not long endure, and within half an hour the
<em>Varyag</em>, trying in vain to inflict damage on her more
numerous enemy, was riddled with shot and shell
and set on fire. The old <em>Korietz</em>, hardly noticed by
the Japanese warships, was also struck, and at last
both steamed back to the harbor, where the wounded
and dying were cared for. That neither ship might
fall into the possession of the enemy, the <em>Varyag</em>
was scuttled, and the <em>Korietz</em> blown up. The Russian
transport that had first sighted the enemy was
burned.</p>

<p>The coast was now clear for landing all the
troops the Mikado cared to send to Korea, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
squadron steamed away to convoy more transports
hither. How this work went on we shall learn in
the near future.</p>

<p>Instead of abating the snowstorm increased in
violence, and by ten o’clock that night the wind was
blowing a perfect gale. In that quarter of the Yellow
Sea a gale means something, and the <em>O-Taka</em> was
tossed about like a feather on the high rolling waves.
Many of the women and children on board were sick,
and even some of the men suffered.</p>

<p>“Very much bad storm,” sighed Jiru Siko, to
Gilbert. “Ship look he would turn down side up—all
things go hop-hop in cabin—Jiru Siko go
hop-hop inside—he think he going to lose his
liver.”</p>

<p>“You’re seasick, Siko,” answered the young
American. “You can’t stand the rolling of the
ship.”</p>

<p>“Master Pennington not feel hop-hop inside, no
turn inside out on his liver?”</p>

<p>“No, I am thankful to say that I don’t feel sick
a bit.”</p>

<p>“You strong man—wish Jiru Siko feel dat way—give
a <em>yen</em> to feel so!” A <em>yen</em> is a Japanese dollar,
worth about fifty-five cents of our money.</p>

<p>The captain had already ordered most of the sails
lowered, only keeping up sufficient canvas to make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
the <em>O-Taka</em> mind her helm. The sea was boiling
and foaming on all sides, and the rising and falling
wind shrieked dismally through the rigging, now at
a high note and then at a low. To stand on the deck
without holding fast was impossible, and the little
cabin was crowded to suffocation. There it was
uncomfortably warm, but outside it was bitter cold,
the water forming in sheets of ice on the deck and in
long icicles on the sails and rigging.</p>

<p>“How long do you think this blow will last?”
asked Gilbert, when Captain Toyano happened to
pass him.</p>

<p>“I cannot tell, certainly until morning—perhaps
for twenty-four hours longer.”</p>

<p>“Can we weather it, do you think?”</p>

<p>“I have never yet lost a ship, Mr. Pennington.”</p>

<p>This is all the Japanese commander would say.
But it was plain to see that he was worried, and
with good cause.</p>

<p>Just before the outbreak of the war he had intended
to lay the <em>O-Taka</em> up for repairs, for the
vessel was rather old, and needed her seams looked
after, and a new topmast, as well as some new sails.
But the opportunity for making such repairs had
been lost, and now the ship was handicapped in a
fashion which left her ill-suited to fight out the
storm that was raging.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span></p>

<p>The sailors knew of the trouble, but the captain
did not wish to alarm his passengers, and so told
them nothing. The <em>O-Taka</em> was already shipping
much water, and the pump was kept going continuously.</p>

<p>Sleep for all on board was out of the question,
and the most Gilbert could do was to lash himself
fast to a railing near the lee of the cabin. Jiru Siko
had joined his family, but others of the Japanese
refugees were close at hand, doing what they could
to keep their blood in circulation, and a few praying
to their gods that daybreak might still find them in
the land of the living.</p>

<p>It was about three in the morning when the worst
of the blow was felt. The wind shrieked with increased
fury, and in the midst of this came a report
like that of a cannon. The mainmast of the ship had
broken off about six feet above deck. Down it came,
partly over the bow, carrying a railing, some
spars, and a great mass of rigging and canvas
with it. At once the ship veered around and
came up sideways to the fury of the high-running
sea.</p>

<p>But little could be heard in such a wind, yet Captain
Toyano made his men understand what was best
to do, and while some held life-lines, others chopped
away the wreckage with axes. Then the <em>O-Taka</em><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
gave a sudden lurch, and the broken mast, with
spars, rigging, and sails, slipped overboard and out
of sight in the darkness. Soon the ship righted herself,
and those handling her did what they could to
keep her up to the wind.</p>

</div>

<p>By daybreak the worst of the blow was over, and
shortly before noon the snow ceased to fall, and the
sun began to struggle through the clouds. Still it
was bitterly cold and those on deck had to keep
muffled up. As it was, one of the sailors had had a
hand frozen during the night and several were
suffering from nipped noses and ears. The blood
in Gilbert’s left foot refused to circulate properly and
that member felt as if half dead.</p>

<p>The storm had opened the seams of the vessel
worse than ever, and the sailors had all they could do
to keep the craft from becoming water-logged. The
pump was in constant use, one gang of pumpers relieved
another, and in addition some water was
drawn from the hold by means of big pails and
ropes. All realized that their very lives depended
upon keeping the water below the safety-line, and all
worked like Trojans in consequence.</p>

<p>“Let me work too,” said Gilbert, and the others
were glad enough to let him take hold and do his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
share. The work warmed him up, and presently
the foot that was numb began to feel better.</p>

<p>The day proved a long and uncertain one for all
on board of the <em>O-Taka</em>. Whether they would float
or go down was a problem which any moment might
answer to their undoing. In the afternoon the
water in the hold began to gain rapidly.</p>

<p>“We are lost!” cried one of the sailors. “We
shall go down in another hour!”</p>

<p>Two of the men on board, one a carpenter and the
other a cabinet maker, went below and made an
examination of the leaks for the third time. They
reported two new leaks, but said both might be
stopped up. Canvas was brought out for that purpose,
and several planks torn from the cabin, and
the pair set to work. In the end the worst leaks
were mended and then the water came in no more
rapidly than it had early in the morning.</p>

<p>Yet the prospect was a gloomy one, and as night
came on the fears of those on board increased. The
wind had driven the ship for miles out of her course,
and even the captain could not tell how close they
were to land.</p>

<p>“We may be thirty, and we may be sixty miles,”
said he, in reply to a question from Gilbert.</p>

<p>“Then there is no danger of our striking on the
rocks?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span></p>

<p>“I will not say that. There are a great number of
rocks and sunken reefs in this vicinity.”</p>

<p>Utterly worn out with watching, a few on board
of the <em>O-Taka</em> fell asleep. Gilbert could scarcely
keep his eyes open, yet he felt in no mental condition
to retire. Some of the children cried bitterly, especially
because of the scantiness of the rations provided.
Everything to eat and to drink was dealt out
sparingly, for nobody could tell how long the stores
would have to last.</p>

<p>It was a night that appeared to have no end, and
when at last day broke it found the watchers all but
exhausted. Now some of the sailors slept, only
awaking when their strength was needed at the
pump or the water buckets.</p>

<p>All day long an anxious lookout was kept for a
sail, but none came within hailing distance. Once a
bark passed to the southward, and they saw the
smoke of a steamer to the westward, but that was
all.</p>

<p>With the mainmast gone the <em>O-Taka</em> merely
crawled along at a speed of less than five knots an
hour. To rig a jury mast was out of the question,
since most of the canvas belonging to the ship had
either been lost overboard or used to stop up the
worst of the leaks.</p>

<p>“We’ll not sink, unless another storm strikes us,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
said the captain. “The worst enemy we have to
fear at present is hunger.”</p>

<p>“How much longer will the stores last?” asked
Gilbert.</p>

<p>“I shall make them last three days, although we
could use everything up to-day.”</p>

<p>“And after that?”</p>

<p>“I’ll try to make land somehow.”</p>

<p>“On the coast of Korea?”</p>

<p>“To be sure—that is the only land that is near.”</p>

<p>Again night came on, and two sailors, who had
been permitted to sleep the greater part of the day,
were placed on the lookout. Gilbert tried to rest,
and almost before he knew it he was in a heavy
slumber.</p>

<p>His awakening was a rude one. There came a
sudden shock that bowled him over and over and
almost sent him into the sea. Then, as he grasped
a stanchion for support, the <em>O-Taka</em> struck again
and almost went over. Yells of alarm arose on the
air, and men, women, and children came pouring
from the cabin.</p>

<p>“What have we struck?”</p>

<p>“The gods defend us! Is it another warship?”</p>

<p>“Are we all to be drowned at last?”</p>

<p>So the cries ran on. In the meantime the vessel
righted herself once more, and then it could be seen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
that she had slipped over a reef. Another reef was
ahead, and again she pounded and scraped, and
more cries arose, until it was as if Bedlam had been
let loose. In terror a few leaped overboard,
and sad to relate, these people were never seen
again.</p>

<p>But the immediate danger was now over, and
directly ahead was a long, low stretch of marsh land,
with several little bays and inlets. Straight for one
of the inlets went the ship, and soon reached a spot
only a few feet from solid ground. Then an anchor
was thrown out, what little sail was up was lowered;
and the perilous voyage came to an end.</p>

<p>At first those who were on the ship could not
realize the truth of what had occurred—that the
vessel had come to a tolerably safe landing, and that
the dangers of shipwreck or starvation were past.
They stared at one another and at the captain.</p>

<p>“We have struck somewhere on the southwest
coast of Korea,” said Captain Toyano. “The vessel
will be as safe here as if she was tied up in Nagasaki
harbor so far as our passengers are concerned. But
I am afraid that the gallant <em>O-Taka</em> has seen the
last of her sea trips,” and he turned away sadly, for
the vessel was his sole property and all he had to
depend upon for a living. Let it be added here
that, later on, the ship was drawn from the inlet and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
overhauled, and proved almost as seaworthy as ever,
much to the old salt’s satisfaction.</p>

<p>There was nothing to do but to wait until daylight,
and, once the vessel was properly secured, by the
anchor and by ropes tied to stakes driven into the
marsh land, all on board but a few sailors went to
sleep. Gilbert was glad to rest once again, and now
made up for the greater part of the sleep lost during
the voyage.</p>

<p>In the morning half a dozen Korean fishermen
appeared, well bundled up, and with their queer-looking
hats pulled well down over their ears. They were
much surprised to find a ship at hand, but promised
to do what they could for those on board. None of
them had heard of the war between Russia and
Japan, but when they did they at once took sides
with their Japanese neighbors. They promised to
bring dried fish, and some rice, as well as fresh
water, and out of his own pocket Gilbert paid for
some flour, some dried fruits, and some beans.</p>

<p>“I don’t mind your rice and dried fish,” he said
to Jiru Siko, “but I can’t live on it right along.”</p>

<p>“Rice and fish very good,” replied the little brown
man, who, now that the danger was over, was quite
himself once more. “Make much muscle, good wind—can
live on rice and fish.”</p>

<p>From one of the fishermen Gilbert learned that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
the ship had been stranded at a point about sixty
miles south of Chemulpo, and that there was a fairly
good road leading to the latter named seaport.
There was also another road leading over the mountains
to Fu-san, on the southeast coast of the Land
of the Morning Calm, as Korea is locally called.</p>

<p>“Japanese steamers stop at both Chemulpo and
at Fu-san,” said Captain Toyano, “or at least, they
did so before this war broke out. If you wish to
leave us I should advise you to go to Chemulpo,
which is close to Seoul, the capital. All trade centers
at Seoul, and if you get into any further trouble it
will be best for you to be within call of that city.”</p>

<p>Matters were talked over for several hours, and in
the end Gilbert arranged to be taken in a pony cart
to Chemulpo. Jiru Siko remained behind with his
family, and it was a long time before the young
American saw his faithful Japanese friend again.</p>

<p>“I shan’t forget you, Siko,” said Gilbert, on
parting. “You did a great deal for me.”</p>

<p>“Master Pennington do much for me,” was the
reply. “Send Russian rent man ’bout business—make
rent man give up money—nice thing to do—not
forget dat! We come together some day—when
Jiru Siko soldier, maybe;” and so they parted.</p>

<p>Gilbert had with him for company a sailor named
Nouye, sent to Chemulpo by Captain Toyano.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
There was also the driver of the cart, an elderly
Korean, who insisted upon having his pay for the trip
before they started. As the amount was less than
two dollars and fifty cents in our money Gilbert furnished
the cash without hesitation. It was likewise
agreed that the young American should pay about
forty cents for a night’s lodging for himself and his
companion, and twenty cents for food for the driver
and his ponies.</p>

<p>Under other circumstances Gilbert would have
noted many things on that trip through a new country.
But the weather remained cold, with another
light fall of snow, and he was glad to bundle himself
up and huddle down in the cart to keep warm. Yet
he noticed that in general the air was much drier than
in Manchuria and consequently more healthful. As
a whole, the climate of the Land of the Morning
Calm is delightful, the spring and autumn being
unexcelled anywhere for clearness and balminess,
and the summer being far from sultry. To be sure,
there is some bad weather, and a few days when the
thermometer climbs into the nineties in the shade,
but these are the exceptions.</p>

<p>The night’s stop was at a long row of <em>nipa</em> huts,
some used as dwellings and others as stages. Much
to his surprise, Gilbert was offered a fairly good bed
and also a supper and a breakfast with which he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
could find no fault. He also met a Korean who
could speak fairly good English.</p>

<p>“I learned your tongue from a missionary,” said
the Korean. “I worked for him at his church. He
was a nice man.”</p>

<p>“And where is the missionary now?” questioned
Gilbert.</p>

<p>“He has gone away. The Russians came here
and they made it unpleasant for him.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“I know not, excepting it might be that they
wanted to establish their own church.”</p>

<p>“And have they done that?”</p>

<p>“Not yet. But they are coming sooner or later.
They are now in the north of my land. They are
pressing us hard.”</p>

<p>“But the Japanese may drive them out.”</p>

<p>“I trust they do. We do not want any Russians
in the Land of the Morning Calm.” And there the
talk came to an end.</p>

<span class="fs80">OLD COMRADES IN ARMS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The town and harbor of Chemulpo are in reality
the seaport for Seoul, the capital of Korea, which is
inland about fifty miles. The harbor proper is a
small affair and large vessels usually lie in the
roadstead outside. Along the shore are clustered a
number of wooden houses, painted white, and back of
these are a small hill and a larger settlement, divided
into Chinese, Japanese, and English, French, and
German quarters. In the latter are hotels of fairly
good size, a bank, schools, and churches. The trade
is largely in the hands of the Japanese and Chinese,
and almost all of the shipping is Japanese.</p>

<p>The sights in the town interested Gilbert very
much, especially such as were to be seen in the
Korean quarter proper. Here were long string of
stalls, piled high with various things on sale, and
the streets were alive with people, for the Koreans
believe in keeping “on the go” constantly.</p>

<p>The sailor, Nouye, knew of a good Japanese hotel,
and conducted the young American hither, where he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
was given a fair-sized room, heated, for his benefit,
with a small foot stove. Gilbert was also introduced
to several people at the hotel, so that he might
not feel altogether strange. Then the sailor left
him and he was allowed to shift for himself.</p>

<p>The ex-lieutenant needed a rest after his adventures
on the Yellow Sea, and he determined to take it
easy for several days before deciding upon what to do
next. He learned that there was no steamer in the
harbor bound for Nagasaki or any other port in
Japan, and there was no telling when there would
be.</p>

<p>“I rather reckon the <em>Columbia</em> and those on
board will have to take care of themselves,” he
reasoned. “I wish I was with them, but I’ve got to
take what comes.”</p>

<p>The young American remained at the Japanese
hotel just for one day, and then moved to another
resort, kept by an Englishman named David Penworth.
Here accommodations were also good, and
the ex-lieutenant had the satisfaction of hearing his
native tongue spoken once more.</p>

<p>“Quite a few Americans have enlisted for this
war,” said David Penworth. “I had some of them
in here a couple of days ago.”</p>

<p>“On the Japanese side?” questioned Gilbert.</p>

<p>“To be sure. I don’t believe any of them have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
joined the Russians. They seem to take to the Japs—they
are such sturdy chaps, don’t you know.”</p>

<p>“They are that. Are those Americans who enlisted
around now?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, they came in from the Japanese camp,
some miles from here. But, for all I know, they
may be down again.”</p>

<p>Gilbert soon learned that the Japanese were landing
troops not only at Chemulpo but also at Chinampo,
a small treaty port about a hundred and fifty
miles further north, and at Haiju, another place
located midway between those first named.</p>

<p>The weather that these troops had to face was,
for a while, terrible. The snow was heavy, the wind
high, and camp accommodations very insufficient.
Each soldier had to carry nearly a hundred pounds
of baggage, and with this they struggled along,
making marches of twenty to twenty-five miles a
day.</p>

<p>The objective point of the Japanese army at that
time was Ping-Yang, a place of considerable importance
on the Tai-tong River. As soon as a sufficient
army force was on hand, the Japanese proceeded
to fortify Ping-Yang, and then more troops
were sent in until, by the middle of March, there
were over 80,000 soldiers in that vicinity, all forming
the First Army Corps, under General Kuroki,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
a commander well known for his skill and daring
in the art of warfare.</p>

<p>Gilbert had hoped to meet some of his own countrymen
at Chemulpo, but he was not prepared for the
surprise in store for him. One day he was near the
docks, watching the arrival of a regiment of Japanese
soldiers, when he noticed a body of sharpshooters
having at their head a first sergeant whose
face looked strangely familiar.</p>

<p>“Dan Casey, or am I dreaming!” he cried, and
ran forward to get a better look at the individual.</p>

<p>“Well, be the powers, if it ain’t Leftenant Pennington!”
came in a rich Irish brogue. “An’ to
think we’d be after matin’ in such an outlandish
place as this.” And leaving his command Dan
Casey, who, as my old readers know, had served on
many a battlefield with Gilbert, rushed to the ex-lieutenant’s
side, and grasped his hand warmly.</p>

<p>“Then it is really you, Casey? I was afraid I
was mistaken.”</p>

<p>“Sure an’ it’s meself, leftenant. I’m a bould
sodger b’y onct more, glory be to the Mikado’s flag,
which, by that same token, but privately, ain’t half as
handsome as Old Glory, is it now?”</p>

<p>“Where did you enlist? I’ve been wondering
what became of you after we parted in the regular
army.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span></p>

<p>“Sure an’ I’ve been dhriftin’ around, along with
Carl Stummer. First we wint to the Philippines, thin
Korea, an’ thin to Japan, workin’ whin we had to
an’ seein’ the soights whin our pockets were lined,
which same was not often. Both of us were down
to hard-pan whin this war broke out, an’ says I to
Carl, says I, ‘Lit’s go to th’ front.’ ‘Done wid
ye,’ says he, an’ the next day we puts our names to
a paper two yards long an’ covered wid plasters.”</p>

<p>“But you are a first sergeant?”</p>

<p>“Sure!” Dan Casey put up his finger knowingly.
“They thought I was a captain in Uncle Sam’s army
an’ I lit them remain under that impression. Carl’s
me second sergeant, so he is.”</p>

<p>At this point another individual, short and rather
stocky, came up, also dressed in the uniform of a
Japanese soldier. For a moment he stared in amazement
at Gilbert, then rushed in and embraced the ex-lieutenant.</p>

<p>“Vell, py chimanatics!” he burst out. “Of dis
ton’t peat der pand annahow! Lieutenant Bennington,
or I vas plind! How in der vorld did you got
here, told me dot. Vas you in der army too?”</p>

<p>“How are you, Stummer?” and Gilbert shook
hands warmly with the former soldier of the U. S.
regulars. “I declare, it seems like old times to see
you and Casey together, and in army uniform. No,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
I am not in the army, but I may be, if I see many
more of our old crowd joining. So you are a
sergeant, and Casey too. Let me congratulate
you.”</p>

<p>“Dank you, lieutenant. Yah, I vas an officer
now. Casey, he gits me dot chob. Dan vos a great
feller annahow. He makes dem dink he vos a major,
or somedings like dot.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I was after lettin’ ’em do their own guessing,”
put in Dan Casey. “But we really got in on
our merits,” he added. “’Tis a company of sharpshooters
we have, an’ Carl an’ I had to qualify for
our positions.”</p>

<p>“And what score did you make?” questioned Gilbert,
with a soldier’s keen interest in such matters.</p>

<p>“Oh, I was lucky. I got ninety-six points out of
a possible hundred, an’ Carl got ninety-six points.
The Japs thought both were great scores.”</p>

<p>“And they were,” answered Gilbert, for he himself
was a good marksman, but had never done
quite as well. “Where are you bound for?” he
added, after a pause.</p>

<p>“We have orders to Ping-yang. After
that I’m afther thinkin’ we’ll get orders to drive the
Russians northward beyand the Yalu River—if we
can do it.”</p>

<p>“Put ve ton’t vos do dot right avay,” came from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
Carl Stummer. “Ve got to vait for besser veather.
Dis vos den-dimes vorse nor dot rainy season in
Luzon, ven we sleep in vater a foot teep. Maype
you remember dot, hey?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I remember,” said Gilbert, with a short
laugh. “But we had some pretty interesting times,
for all that, didn’t we?”</p>

<p>“Oxactly so.”</p>

<p>“I’m wishin’ fer thim same times this minit,” put
in Dan Casey. “Sure an’ ye must enlist, leftenant.
Say the wurrd, an’ I’ll do all in me power to git ye
a commission.”</p>

<p>“No, I can’t do that—at least, not now;” and
then Gilbert told the pair about his business affairs,
and how anxious he was regarding the <em>Columbia</em>
and those on board.</p>

<p>“So Ben Russell and his brother Larry are on
board,” cried Dan Casey. “That’s as interestin’ as
it is to mate you, so it is! Sure an’ I’d like to see
’em.”</p>

<p>“Maype da vos into dis fight, too,” said Carl
Stummer. “Pen Russell vos a porn fighter, remember
dot.”</p>

<p>“An’ Larry could go into the navy,” said Casey.
“A fellow that fought wid Dewey could enlist on
any Japanese warship.”</p>

<p>Unfortunately the sharpshooters had to move on,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
so Gilbert could not question the pair of old comrades
in arms farther. But he made an appointment
for that evening, and the three spent several hours
together, talking over old times and speculating over
the future. Both Casey and Stummer urged Gilbert
to enlist, and at last the ex-lieutenant promised to
think the matter over.</p>

<p>“An’ if ye do, be sure to git wid us,” said Dan
Casey.</p>

<p>“Yah, do dot py all means,” added Carl Stummer,
and Gilbert promised to keep the whole matter
in mind.</p>

<p>After Casey and Stummer had departed the young
American thought over the matter for a good hour.
He had spent many years of life in army service, but
in the past this had been only under Old Glory. It
would be a new experience to march under the
Mikado’s flag. Yet a great many Americans were
doing it.</p>

<p>“If I join the Japanese army, I’d be a regular
soldier of fortune and no mistake,” he mused.
“Well, I might do worse. After all, army service
is largely a matter of business—when it isn’t the
army of one’s own country. I don’t know but that I
could fight just as hard for the Mikado as I have for
Uncle Sam.” And there, for the time being, he
dropped the matter. He would not have considered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
taking up arms against the Russians had he not been
so badly treated at Port Arthur.</p>

<p>The very next day after the meeting just recorded
a vessel arrived at Chemulpo carrying large
quantities of army stores for the Japanese soldiers.
The vessel was from Nagasaki, and Gilbert lost no
time in visiting the ship and asking for the latest
shipping news from that port.</p>

<p>“You may look over the papers,” said the purser,
and handed him copies of the <em>Mainichi</em>, which means
<em>Daily</em>, and of several sheets devoted largely to
Japanese shipping interests.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, but I haven’t got to reading Japanese
yet,” said Gilbert, and was then handed a copy of
the <cite>Japan Mail</cite>, and also a copy of the <cite>Japan Times</cite>,
both published in English.</p>

<p>Sitting down, the young American looked the
two sheets over with interest. At first he could find
nothing of what he wanted, but at last caught a
paragraph which instantly commanded his attention.
The paragraph stated that the <em>Columbia</em>, Captain
Ponsberry, had arrived at Nagasaki, with a mixed
cargo consigned to various ports. She had expected
to sail for ports in Korea and Manchuria, but owing
to the war, the captain was awaiting further orders
from the owners.</p>

<p>“I hope she stays at Nagasaki until I can get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
there,” said Gilbert to himself. “If she’ll do that,
perhaps we can make something out of what’s on
board. The Japanese are paying big prices for
stores of all kinds just now. I wish I could sail for
Nagasaki at once.”</p>

<p>The opportunity to sail for the Japanese seaport
named came sooner than expected. That very afternoon
a steamer came in from an upper port. She
was bound for Nagasaki direct, and Gilbert had but
little difficulty in procuring passage, although he had
to pay just twice the regular fare. But in war times
this was to be expected.</p>

<p>“And if a Russian warship sinks us, you must
not complain,” said the captain of the steamer, after
the bargain had been made.</p>

<p>“All right. I’ll take my medicine the same as
the rest,” returned the young American.</p>

<span class="fs80">ON BOARD THE “COLUMBIA”</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The steamer bound for Nagasaki left Chemulpo
harbor early on the following morning, with sixteen
passengers and eight army officers on board. The
army officers were a fine set of men, and Gilbert soon
got well acquainted with all of them.</p>

<p>“Japan is simply fighting for her rights,” said
one of the officers, during the trip. “We want no
Russian interference with our trade.”</p>

<p>“I cannot blame you,” was the ex-lieutenant’s
answer. “I know Uncle Sam would not allow any
tampering with our commerce.”</p>

<p>During the talk it developed that three of the
army officers had served in China during the Boxer
uprising, and they were surprised to learn that Gilbert
had been a lieutenant in the United States army
at that time, and was thinking somewhat of joining
the Japanese forces.</p>

<p>“We shall certainly be glad to have you with us,”
said one of the Japanese. “We are raising such a
vast army that we are rather handicapped for
capable officers.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span></p>

<p>“Then you think I could get a commission?”</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly.”</p>

<p>“As what?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps as captain, and even higher.”</p>

<p>“That is certainly worth remembering. I should
not wish to enlist as a mere private.”</p>

<p>“If you desire, when we arrive at Nagasaki, I
will introduce you to some military authorities who
have great influence.”</p>

<p>“Very well, Captain Okopa; if I decide to join,
I’ll be glad to have you do that.”</p>

<p>“We expect some hard fighting.”</p>

<p>“Well, I won’t mind that, once I am in the field;
indeed, I’d rather fight than hang around a camp
any time.”</p>

<p>“So would I, lieutenant. It takes all the energy
out of a man to lie around camp for a week or a
month.”</p>

<p>“I suppose the Russians will send a big army into
Korea and Manchuria, too.”</p>

<p>“They will probably send as many soldiers as
they can get to the front. But you must remember,
they are a long distance from home, so to speak.
They can send troops only on the single railroad, or
on foot.”</p>

<p>“They are rushing troops into Port Arthur at a
lively enough rate.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span></p>

<p>“That is the end of their railroad line, and they
probably feel that they must hold the railroad at any
cost. Besides, they want to hold Port Arthur itself
if they can, in spite of our navy and our army.”</p>

<p>“Will your navy attack Port Arthur?”</p>

<p>“More than likely they will. They have already
sunk some Russian warships stationed there. I
fancy our ships may try to bottle up the Russian
fleet, just as your Hobson tried to bottle up Admiral
Cervera at Santiago.”</p>

<p>The Japanese officer was correct in his surmise,
and the attempt to blockade Port Arthur was made
by Admiral Togo late in February.</p>

<p>For this purpose five old steamers were obtained,
and they were heavily loaded with stones and explosives.
Volunteers to man the doomed vessels
were called for, and the result was the same as when
volunteers were called for at Santiago—nearly the
whole of the navy wanted to go! Men known for
their coolness and bravery were selected, and in the
darkness of the night of the 24th, the heavily-laden
vessels were headed for the harbor entrance.</p>

<p>The Russians, however, were on the alert, and
soon, despite the bad weather, the enemy were discovered,
and the land batteries opened a heavy fire
on the doomed ships. As a consequence one was
grounded three miles from the harbor, where she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
blew up, and another sank but a short distance away.
A third had her steering gear shot away and then
blew up.</p>

<p>Only two ships now remained and these, despite
the awful rain of shot and shell, reached the harbor
entrance and were anchored. Then those on board
got out their small boats, set fire to the fuses placed
in readiness, and rowed away for their lives.
Shortly afterwards the two loaded ships blew up.
A lively fire was directed at the small boats, but,
strange as it may seem, not one of them was hit.
But in the darkness and because of the heavy wind
that was blowing, the small boats got far out of
their proper course, and it was not until three o’clock
the next day that they were picked up by the big
ships standing off outside of the harbor.</p>

<p>The two ships sunk at the harbor entrance did not
block the channel completely. But, combined with
the wrecks of the sunken Russian warships, they
made the passageway very difficult. After this exploit
was over Admiral Togo began a strict blockade
of the port, with frequent and highly destructive
bombardments.</p>

<p>Night and day a strict watch was kept for the
possible appearance of a Russian warship. Once
there was an alarm which quickly brought Gilbert
to the deck. A big warship was seen approaching.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
Her flag was flying, but what it was nobody, at first,
could make out.</p>

<p>“If she’s a Russian, we are as good as done for,”
was one of the passengers’ comment. “She’ll sink
us just as sure as fate.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think she’ll do it until after she has taken
us passengers off,” replied Gilbert. “It wouldn’t
be right.”</p>

<p>Slowly the warship came closer, and the captain of
the steamer watched her eagerly through his glasses.</p>

<p>“She doesn’t look like a Russian,” he said slowly.
“But she may be, nevertheless.”</p>

<p>At last all doubts were dispelled, for the flag
swung around broadside to the steamer. It was the
Union Jack of England.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” shouted Gilbert. “That lets us
down easily.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I must say I am not sorry,” returned
Captain Okopa. “I wish another chance to fight on
land.”</p>

<p>Soon the English warship was within hailing distance.
She wished to know if the steamer
had seen anything of a British merchantman named
the <em>Defender</em>.</p>

<p>“Haven’t seen or heard of her,” was the reply.
“For what port was she bound?” But the
Englishman would not answer this question, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
soon the warship swung around and was lost to
sight, steaming westward.</p>

<p>“There is going to be great trouble for some
merchantmen,” said Captain Okopa to Gilbert. “If
they carry contraband of war, they are liable to be
sunk.”</p>

<p>“By either nation, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“I am sure the Russians will sink any ship carrying
goods for our nation,—I mean war stores and
other contraband goods. What Japan will do, I do
not know.”</p>

<p>“I reckon they’ll do some sinking just as quick,”
said the young American. “Your work at Port
Arthur shows that you are mightily in earnest in this
affair.”</p>

<p>The run to Nagasaki was made in safety, and
three days after leaving Chemulpo the steamer came
to anchor at her dock in the Japanese port. As Gilbert
had visited Nagasaki a number of times, the
scenes around him—the strange-looking craft, the
flags of various nations, and the small boats filled
with stores and floating about, trading—were no
novelty to him. He longed to get ashore and hunt
up the old <em>Columbia</em> and those on board.</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="p134" style="max-width: 42.9375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/p134.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent"><span class="smcap">“Hullo, Ben! Hullo, Larry!” exclaimed Gilbert.</span><br>
<em>Page <a href="#Page_135">135</a>.</em></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>But there were certain formalities to be gone
through before he could leave the steamer. His
hand-bag was thoroughly searched, and he was asked
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>numerous questions. At last all appeared to be
satisfactory to the Japanese officials, and he was told
he could land and do as he pleased.</p>

<p>It took the young American but a few minutes to
ascertain where the <em>Columbia</em> lay, and he lost not a
moment in picking his way along the docks in that
direction. On all sides were great heaps of army
stores, awaiting transportation to Korea and
Manchuria. There could be no doubt but that
this war was to be carried through on a large
scale.</p>

<p>At last he found the ship with which he was so
familiar. There on the deck stood that veteran
of the sea, Captain Nat Ponsberry, of Gloucester,
as hale and hearty as ever. Close at hand was his
first mate, Tom Grandon, and not for away were
Ben Russell and his younger brother Larry.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Ben! Hullo, Larry!” exclaimed Gilbert.
“Glad to see you!”</p>

<p>“Gilbert Pennington!” ejaculated the Russell
brothers, in a breath. And then they leaped forward
to embrace the newcomer.</p>

<p>“Where in the world did you drop from?” asked
Ben.</p>

<p>“We were talking about you not five minutes
ago,” put in Larry. “We were wondering how
soon we’d hear from you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span></p>

<p>“I came from Chemulpo,” answered Gilbert,
shaking first one hand and then another. He
turned to the master of the <em>Columbia</em>. “How are
you, Captain Ponsberry? How are you, Grandon?”</p>

<p>“I’m fust-rate, Mr. Pennington,” came from the
captain. “How are you? But I needn’t ask, fer
ye look as fit as a fiddle. I reckon as how them
Roossians haven’t worried ye, none, after all, have
they?”</p>

<p>“Haven’t they, though? Just you wait until I
spin my yarn, as you sailors call it. I’m mighty
glad you stayed at Nagasaki.”</p>

<p>“So I said as how you would be,” said Tom
Grandon, who was a bosom friend of the captain and
privileged to speak at all times. “I said we’d better
await orders.”</p>

<p>“Have you seen any of the fighting?” questioned
Larry, his eyes bright with anticipation.</p>

<p>“Yes, I saw the sinking of the Russian warships
at Port Arthur. I thought of you and the fight in
Manila Bay at the time, Larry.”</p>

<p>“Wish I had been there,” declared the young
sailor. He thought of his own days behind one of
the big guns, while serving under Admiral Dewey,
as already recorded by me in “Under Dewey at
Manila.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span></p>

<p>“But I thought you said you had come from
Chemulpo,” put in Ben.</p>

<p>“So I did, Ben. But I’ll have to tell my story in
detail before you’ll understand it. First of all,
though, let me ask Captain Ponsberry if his cargo
is safe.”</p>

<p>“As safe as when we left home,” declared the
master of the <em>Columbia</em>.</p>

<p>“Good! Have you received any orders from
home since you arrived here?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“What orders?”</p>

<p>“That I wasn’t to attempt to deliver anything
until I heard from you.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad of that.” Gilbert drew a deep breath.
“That takes a weight off my shoulders. Now the
next thing to do, captain, is to throw the most of
those old orders for goods overboard.”</p>

<p>“I said you’d sell the Japanese,” declared Ben.
“They are paying the best of prices for everything.”</p>

<p>“Exactly; and we’ll run no risk of having the
cargo confiscated if we sell in Nagasaki,” added
Gilbert.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t mind running a risk on the high
seas,” came from Larry, with a smile. “I’d like a
little excitement.”</p>

<p>“And a brush with the enemy, eh, Larry? I see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
you are the same as of old,” and Gilbert laughed.
“I’ve got to congratulate you on becoming second
mate,” he continued.</p>

<p>“Tell us your story, Gilbert,” said Ben. “I’m
dying to hear what has happened,” and then the
party adjourned to the cabin of the schooner, where
each told his tale in detail.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV<br>
<span class="fs80">JOINING THE JAPANESE ARMY</span></h2>
</div>

<p>All on board of the <em>Columbia</em> had had an uneventful
voyage to the Sea of Japan and everybody
was in the best of health. Since arriving at
Nagasaki those on the vessel had heard much about
the war just opened and had seen not a few Japanese
soldiers depart for the front. Larry and Ben had
likewise visited one of the warships, just before it
departed to join Admiral Togo’s fleet, and both were
enthusiastic over what they had seen.</p>

<p>“The order was as good as on any American
warship,” declared Larry, “and the gunners looked
as if they could fire just as well, too.”</p>

<p>“Did you see any Americans?” questioned
Gilbert.</p>

<p>“At least half a dozen—two that were with
Dewey at Manila, and one that was on board the
<em>Brooklyn</em> with my brother Walter, at the time our
navy was fighting in Cuban waters. They told me
that the Japanese navy had a great many Americans
on its ships.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span></p>

<p>“I’ll wager you were strongly tempted to enlist,
Larry.”</p>

<p>“Well, who wouldn’t be? When a fellow has
once smelt powder the feeling to keep on fighting
gets in one’s bones.”</p>

<p>“That’s just the way I felt, when I saw those
Japanese solders embarking for the front,” declared
Ben. “It put me in mind of the time our
regiment started for Cuba, and when we started for
the Philippines.”</p>

<p>“I believe upon my word, Ben Russell, you want
to go to the front this minute!”</p>

<p>“What about yourself, Gilbert? Now come, tell
the plain truth.”</p>

<p>“Do you want the plain truth, and nothing but
the truth, as they say in court?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then I’d join the Japanese army to-morrow if
it wasn’t for my duty here, and if I was sure I could
get a commission. I don’t at all like the way I was
treated at Port Arthur by the Russians, and I’d just
like the chance to square accounts with them.”</p>

<p>“Hurrah! let’s all go to war!” burst out
Larry. “You two can be officers, while I’ll be a
high private in the rear rank.” And he began to
march around in true military style, with an imaginary
gun on his shoulder. “By column of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
fours, march! Left wheel! Halt! Captain Pennington
will deploy to the left. Captain Russell will
send out an advance guard under High Private
Russell to see if the Russian warships are hiding
anywhere behind yonder huckleberry bushes.”</p>

<p>“Larry, quit your fooling,” interrupted Ben, and
then burst out laughing. “Gilbert, he’s as bad as
ever. I can’t do a thing with him.”</p>

<p>“Never mind, he’s got the war fever just as bad
as any of us. Isn’t that true, Larry?”</p>

<p>“Just you try me and see. If both of you go to
the front, you’ve got to take me along,—that is, if
Captain Ponsberry will let me go.”</p>

<p>“What! what! are ye going to desert the ship?”
broke in the master of the <em>Columbia</em>. “I can’t
allow this nohow!”</p>

<p>“Oh, captain, you don’t mean that?” pleaded
Larry quickly.</p>

<p>“But what is the <em>Columbia</em> to do without her
second mate?” asked Captain Ponsberry quizzically.</p>

<p>“I’ll find you another hand—just as good as myself.”</p>

<p>“Well, we are not going to war just yet,” put in
Ben. “We want to know a little more about what
is taking place first.”</p>

<p>“Right you are,” came from Gilbert. “And I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
must make some arrangements about the <em>Columbia’s</em>
cargo.”</p>

<p>The ex-lieutenant learned from Captain Ponsberry
that several agents of the Japanese Government
had been inquiring after the <em>Columbia’s</em> cargo
and had left their names and addresses. Gilbert
decided to look these people up on the following day,
and did so, in company with the master of the
ship.</p>

<p>It happened that the vessel carried a number of
things much needed by Japan just at that moment,
and feeling free to sell the cargo as he pleased, Gilbert
was not long in striking a bargain which was
very advantageous to the Richmond Importing Company
and incidentally to himself. More than this,
he took orders for more goods of a similar sort, the
same to be delivered at Nagasaki as soon as possible.
These goods the Richmond Importing Company
had stored at its new warehouse at Manila, and
Captain Ponsberry was directed to make the run to
Luzon and back without delay.</p>

<p>“The company will clear six thousand dollars on
that order,” said Gilbert to the captain, “and if you
hurry it through O. K. you can depend upon it that
you will not be forgotten.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do my best,” answered Captain Ponsberry.</p>

<p>“Of course you understand the risk to be run.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
If a Russian warship catches you, she’ll sink you
sure.”</p>

<p>“I’ll keep my weather eye open for ’em, Mr.
Pennington.”</p>

<p>The prospect of a quick run to Manila and back,
with a possible brush with a Russian cruiser, interested
Larry, and at the last moment he was undecided
whether to remain on the <em>Columbia</em> or go
ashore with his brother Ben.</p>

<p>“Are you going to the front or not?” he asked,
of Ben and Gilbert.</p>

<p>“It’s a toss-up, Larry,” answered his older
brother. “I’ve a very strong notion to see what I
can do about a commission.”</p>

<p>“Then why not go and see before the schooner
sails? Then I’ll know what you are going to do.”</p>

<p>“All right, I’ll go,” said Ben.</p>

<p>That was what Gilbert had in mind to do, and
that afternoon the pair hunted up Captain Okopa.</p>

<p>“I am glad to hear that you are willing to join
us,” cried the Japanese officer, after Ben had been
introduced. “So you have been a captain?” he
went on, to Ben. “I do not know what I can do
for you, but I will do my best.”</p>

<p>He went with them to a recruiting office and there
introduced them to several army officers who
chanced to be present. Both were plied with questions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
and many of their answers were taken down
by a stenographer.</p>

<p>“You can probably get commissions as lieutenants
and perhaps captains,” said one of the officers.
“But your records will be investigated; if not at
once, then later.”</p>

<p>“You are at liberty to do as you please about
that,” answered Gilbert, and Ben said the same.</p>

<p>It may astonish some of my readers to think a
commission in the Japanese army was so easy to
obtain. The truth was, the army of Japan was
being suddenly increased from about a hundred
thousand men to over three hundred thousand men.
Recruits were easy to obtain, for the Japanese is
patriotic to the core and ready at any time to lay his
life down for his Mikado and his country, but many
of the men were untrained in the art of the soldier,
and officers were next to impossible to obtain. So
far not only Americans, but also Englishmen and
Germans had gone to the front as officers of various
grades, while not a few foreigners were also in the
ranks.</p>

<p>The next few days were anxious ones for the two
young Americans. In the meantime Larry decided
to remain with Captain Ponsberry, who told the
young sailor he was glad of it. Ben and Gilbert
saw the <em>Columbia</em> sail, and each waved Larry, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
captain, and the others on board an affectionate
adieu.</p>

<p>“He’s as fine a man as I ever sailed with,” declared
Ben. “I trust they make the trip in safety.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” returned Gilbert. “For their own
sakes as well as for the sake of our company.”</p>

<p>The young Americans had signified that they
would prefer to keep together, and at the end of the
week Captain Okopa came to them and told them
the matter had been arranged.</p>

<p>“I am going to take out a special command of
four companies,” said he. “This is to do special
duty in the field, more of which you will learn later.
I have been appointed major of the command, and if
you wish to go with me I can make both of you
captains.”</p>

<p>“What is the nature of your special work?”
asked Gilbert.</p>

<p>“We shall be used in discovering the enemy’s
position and in holding difficult points,” said the
Japanese, and then he explained as best he could.</p>

<p>The matter was talked over by Gilbert and Ben
for a good hour and then they decided to accept
Major Okopa’s offer. Before night they were
sworn into the service in true Japanese fashion, and
measured for their uniforms.</p>

<p>“Well, we are real Japanese soldiers at last!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
cried Ben. “I declare, I feel like a cat in a strange
garret.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to study up the Japanese tactics,” declared
Gilbert, and he went at it with a vigor. Both
Gilbert and Ben knew a great deal on the subject
already, otherwise they would not have gotten the
commissions dealt out to them.</p>

<p>By the middle of the following week they were
introduced to the solders who were to serve under
them. Much to their surprise the command was
made up largely of students from the Japanese
schools and universities—bright men who were
eager to do all they could for their beloved Japan.
Not a few could speak English, so Gilbert and Ben
felt at home with them almost from the start.</p>

<p>“This is much better than if we had a lot of the
peasantry to deal with,” said Gilbert. “Drilling
these chaps will be more fun than work;” and so it
proved.</p>

<p>The command was quartered some distance outside
of Nagasaki and was drilled twice a day, once
in the morning and once in the afternoon. Major
Okopa had much outside work to attend to, and as a
consequence much of the task of drilling the soldiers
fell upon Gilbert and Ben.</p>

<p>“Let us show them what American officers can
do,” said Gilbert, and they worked harder than ever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
before, until the drill of the battalion was practically
perfect. During that time he and Ben picked up a
great many Japanese army terms, so that they addressed
their men with but little difficulty.</p>

<p>In the meantime the Japanese Government was
losing no time in sending troops to Korea, and every
ship possible to use for a transport was pressed into
the service. The destination of many of the transports
was unknown to all but those high in authority,
even the most alert of the war correspondents being
unable to obtain information.</p>

<p>“Beats all, how the news is kept back,” said one
young man, who represented some Pacific Coast
papers. “But I am no worse off than a score of
other special correspondents.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to the front?” asked Gilbert, who
had become interested in the young newspaper man.</p>

<p>“Will if I get the chance.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you’ll be able to go with us.”</p>

<p>“I’d like that. I can’t get along with these Japs
alone. They talk too fast for me.”</p>

<p>“Have you sent your papers any news at all?”</p>

<p>“Not much. How can I, if it’s not to be got?
I’ve told them about the army here, and the rumors
that are circulating, but if I don’t send more pretty
soon I’m afraid I’ll get my walking papers,” concluded
the correspondent gloomily.</p>

<p>By the first of March over forty transports had
left Nagasaki, all loaded with troops for the front.
Many other transports left China, where great numbers
of guns were shipped and also horses. Major
Okopa kept his command in readiness to leave on a
day’s notice, and at last came word that they would
depart on the first day of the following week.</p>

<span class="fs80">ON THE WAY TO PING-YANG</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“We are off at last!”</p>

<p>It was Gilbert who spoke. Dressed in the uniform
of a Japanese captain of infantry, he stood
upon the deck of the transport <em>Yojirama</em> and saw
the shipping of Nagasaki harbor fading rapidly in
the distance.</p>

<p>The transports to carry soldiers and stores were
twelve in number, and had as a guard three large
warships and two torpedo destroyers. Each transport
was crowded to the utmost, every foot of
deck space being occupied.</p>

<p>“This is pretty much like a cattle ship,” remarked
Ben, who stood near. “I don’t know what we are
going to do if a storm comes up.”</p>

<p>“We’ll do as we’ve done before, Ben,—when
serving under the flag,—make the best of it.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t mind a storm, unless it was a right
out-and-out hurricane,” put in an old sailor who had
joined the army.</p>

<p>“One might expect that, from such a sea-dog as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
you,” laughed Gilbert. “I know you don’t like
anything better than to have it blow great guns.”</p>

<p>“Where are we bound, captain?”</p>

<p>“You’ll have to ask me something easier, Blarco.
To Korea or Manchuria, I reckon.”</p>

<p>“All right—so long as it’s not the North Pole,
I’m satisfied.”</p>

<p>“I imagine we’re going to follow the rest of the
corps that went to Chemulpo and Chinampo,” came
from Ben. “More than likely our troops will strike
at the Russians from across the Yalu River.”</p>

<p>“Sounds rather odd to say <em>our</em> troops, doesn’t
it?”</p>

<p>“It does,—but what else can you say?”</p>

<p>“Nothing. We are under the Mikado’s flag now
and no mistake,” answered Gilbert.</p>

<p>The special command to which the ex-American
lieutenant and his chum belonged occupied the center
portion of the upper deck of the transport. The
weather was no longer bitterly cold, but it was far
from warm, and many of the soldiers were content
to huddle down in sheltered corners, wrapped up in
their army blankets.</p>

<p>All day long the Japanese warship hovered
around the transports, looking for the possible appearance
of a Russian war vessel. It was known
that the enemy had a small fleet stationed at Vladivostok,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
in Siberia, just north of Korea, and it was
thought that this fleet might swoop down upon the
transports and cause serious trouble. But, luckily
for the <em>Yojirama</em> and the other ships, no enemy put
in an appearance.</p>

<p>The truth was, the Vladivostok fleet was still hard
and fast in the ice which blocked that harbor, and it
was not until March 19 that it was able to blast its
way out with dynamite and get into proper trim for
fighting. Then it sailed away, the Japanese spies
knew not whither, but presumably to join the
Russian fleet at Port Arthur. Before this took
place the Japanese endeavored to bombard Vladivostok,
but without material success.</p>

<p>The course of the <em>Yojirama</em> was past the southern
extremity of Korea, and then up the western coast.
There was now no doubt in the minds of the young
Americans but that they were to land as already
surmised, and Gilbert brought out a small map of
Korea and Manchuria which he carried, and began
to study it diligently.</p>

<p>“I want to get the lay of the land in my head,”
he said to his chum. “Then, when we make a
move, I’ll know what we are doing.”</p>

<p>“I want to study that map too,” came from Ben,
and he did so. From it they learned that Korea
was about a hundred and fifty miles from east to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
west, and about six hundred miles from north to
south. It was a peninsula, divided in part from the
mainland by the Yalu River, which marked the
boundary between Korea and Manchuria.</p>

<p>The native name of Korea is Cho-sen or Kao-li,
and for years it was known as the Hermit Kingdom,
because of its efforts to keep out all foreigners. It
was formerly a portion of China, but became independent
in 1895. The population is about eleven
millions, of which about two hundred thousand live
at Seoul, the capital on the river Han. Up to the
present war the monarchy had been an absolute one,
with the exception that many “favors” were
granted to the Russian Government, but now great
changes were about to take place.</p>

<p>Almost before the Koreans knew that the first gun
had been fired a body of Japanese soldiers under
General Inouye, marched upon Seoul and by a showing
of arms compelled the emperor to listen to their
demands. At this time a powerful Russian diplomat,
M. Pavloff, was at Seoul and he was compelled
to leave, being escorted to Chemulpo and placed on
board of an outgoing ship under a Japanese guard.
The Emperor of Korea was then compelled to recognize
the power of Japan, and at once hastened to
congratulate the Mikado on his naval successes, and
said he trusted Japan would be equally successful on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
land. Thereupon a treaty was made between the
two countries by which Japan took sole charge of
all war affairs for both nations, but guaranteeing to
Korea independence in the future. Later still,
through the work of a powerful Japanese diplomat,
Marquis Ito, Japan was given permission to build
railroads through Korea, and occupy whatever
points were necessary for the victorious conduct of
the war. This practically shut the Russians out and
made them bitter in the extreme.</p>

<p>The course of the <em>Yojirama</em>, was now past
Chemulpo harbor, and then it became known that a
landing would be made at Chinampo. This is the
seaport of the important town of Ping-yang, sometimes
known as Phyöng-yang, and located to the
northeast, on the Tai-tong River.</p>

<p>The port of Chinampo is well protected from the
fury of the Yellow Sea, when the winds are high, by
a range of hills, and in this harbor all of the Japanese
transports lost no time in landing their troops. All
sorts of small craft were brought into use, from the
transports’ rowboats to Japanese steam launches,
and Korean <em>sampans</em>, the latter looking very much
like our own mud scows, but with a small covering
of palm leaves or other material over the stern.
The work of landing was carried on day and night,
and it was at two o’clock in the morning when Gilbert<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
and his chum, with their command, found themselves
left on the shore of the little bay, about quarter
of a mile from the town. A stiff breeze was
blowing and it was anything but comfortable.</p>

<p>“I’m going to have a cup of coffee,” said Ben,
and forthwith set a Japanese cook to making the
same. Gilbert joined him, and each drank two
cups, which seemed to do them much good.</p>

<p>The distance from Chinampo to Ping-yang is
about fifty miles, but the route by land or water is
almost twice that distance. To the east and the
west are great ridges of mountains, covered with a
variety of trees and shrubs, nearly all, as yet, bare of
leaves. The main highway into China from Seoul
runs through Ping-yang and also touches Hwang-ju,
which is midway between Ping-yang and the seacoast.</p>

<p>The following noon found the command on the
march to a point where they were to meet another
portion of the army bound for Ping-yang. It was
reported that the soldiers ahead had already had a
skirmish with the Russian outposts, in which none
had been killed but several wounded.</p>

<p>“We’ll be on the firing line before a great while,”
said Gilbert. “The Russians are not going to give
up their hold on Korea, if they can help it.”</p>

<p>Once more, to the surprise of all, the weather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
turned out bitterly cold and there was a slight fall
of snow. Meeting more troops and also several
hundred coolies,—Japanese peasants brought along
to “tote” baggage and stores—the whole body went
into camp far the best part of a week not far from
Hwang-ju.</p>

<p>“This is tough and no mistake,” said the old
sailor, Blarco, as he hugged a small camp-fire which
had been built. “I believe my left foot is about half
frozen.”</p>

<p>“It’s no wonder, since we’ve been marching
through icy slush six inches deep,” replied a brother
soldier. “After all, campaigning in Korea is going
to be no picnic.”</p>

<p>“Did you expect a picnic, when you enlisted?”
asked Gilbert, who was munching a slice of not
over-fresh bread.</p>

<p>“Not at all,” was the prompt answer. “But I
did think spring would be here by this time.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think winter will last much longer,”
said Blarco. “The snow is very wet and it will
soon disappear. But, oh, for a good hot wind from
the south!” and he heaved a sigh.</p>

<p>The young Americans found the town of Hwang-ju
an interesting place, located on a small stream
flowing into the Tai-tong. It is surrounded by such
a wall as surrounds the majority of towns in Korea<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
and China. There are quaint gates and towers.
The Japanese were in command, and a small company
of soldiers was located at the Water Gate,
by the river, and another company at the town-hall.</p>

<p>A large portion of the town was in ruins, and it
was learned from Major Okopa that this was due to
the Chinese-Japanese War of 1894, when the
Chinese were driven from the town by the sturdy
sons of Nippon. At that time many places were
burned or blown up, and to this day only a small
portion of the ruins has been cleared away.</p>

<p>“I’m very much interested in the funny native
shops,” said Blarco, as he and Ben and Gilbert
strolled around. “Just look at the things to sell!
Did you ever see such a mixture?” And mixture it
certainly was, from wooden combs to thin Korean
silks, and from cords for belts to printed
cotton cloths, and white goods such as are rarely seen
at home. There were also special stalls for the sale
of paper, from the heavy and handsome quality used
for floor coverings to the lighter grades used for
walls and for writing and wrapping. Pottery ware
was similar to that seen in Japan, and there was
much in wood besides, and likewise curiously woven
mats, and curtains, and rope harnesses for horses
and ponies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span></p>

<p>“What do these people live on mostly?” asked
Ben.</p>

<p>“I asked that question of the major,” returned
Gilbert. “He says the poorer people live on rice,
peas, and beans, and radishes.”</p>

<p>“Radishes?”</p>

<p>“Exactly. They grow a big radish weighing two
or three pounds, and pickle the thing for winter use,
just as the German puts down sauer-kraut.”</p>

<p>Close at hand was the stall of a butcher, where
were exposed for sale beef and mutton in small
quantities, and also chickens, pheasants, hares, and a
variety of small birds. Beside this stall was one
for the sale of nuts of various kinds, and here the
young Americans purchased some peanuts and some
walnuts, which were as fine as they had ever eaten.</p>

<span class="fs80">SURPRISED BY THE COSSACKS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“Well, here we are at Ping-yang and no sight
of the Russians yet.”</p>

<p>“That is true, Ben; but from all accounts the
enemy are not far distant,” said Gilbert, who was
polishing up his sword, which had become dimmed
by dampness.</p>

<p>“I see you are getting ready for a fight.”</p>

<p>“We didn’t come such a long distance as this to
play. If I’m going to fight, I’d like to get at it. I
hate to grow rusty in a camp, doing nothing.”</p>

<p>“I believe most of the fighting is being done by
the warships,” went on Ben, who was resting on a
heap of straw.</p>

<p>“Well, that is bound to be the case until both the
Russian army and our own are in first-class fighting
trim. Neither side is going to risk a big battle until
then.”</p>

<p>What Ben said about the fights on the sea was
true. The Japanese continued to hammer at Port
Arthur and at the Russian ships stationed there,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
and as a result of several engagements a Japanese
torpedo destroyer was sunk, and a similar vessel of
the Russians blown up by a mine. The losses on
both sides were not heavy. But the constant firing
made all the residents and troops at Port Arthur
very anxious, and many foreigners lost no time in
quitting the city. In the meantime the work on the
Russian defenses went on as before, and a Russian
army began to come down from northern Manchuria
to give the city relief should the Japanese endeavor
to capture it, a movement begun but a short while
later.</p>

<p>Three days after the conversation recorded above
Major Okopa came to the quarters of the command
in suppressed excitement.</p>

<p>“There is work for us to do at last,” said he,
after calling Gilbert, Ben, and his other officers
together. “We go on the march at sundown
to-day.”</p>

<p>“May I ask where to?” asked Gilbert.</p>

<p>“We are to move northward on the road to
An-ju and Chong-ju,” was the answer. “It is reported
that the Russians are sending out troops
around one of the mountain passes. We are to
learn if this is correct, and if so we are to open fire,
for the purpose of learning how strong the command
really is.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span></p>

<p>“That suits me,” cried Gilbert. And Ben echoed
the sentiment.</p>

<p>Soon after that the soldiers were set to work
packing their belongings. The stores of the commissary
department were taken care of by twenty-odd
coolies and a score of Korean donkeys and
ponies. Many of the stores were in big, square
boxes, and it was a queer sight to see a donkey or
pony coming along with a big box strapped on
each side, and perhaps another on top of him.
Behind the animal would trot a coolie, carrying
another box, or a big package, on his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Those coolies are no better than slaves,” declared
Gilbert.</p>

<p>“That is true,” said Major Okopa. “But they
are as faithful as anybody you can imagine.”</p>

<p>It was known for a fact that the Russians had
some troops at Chong-ju, so the advance through the
mountains had to be made with caution. The
Russian command was composed of six squadrons
of Cossacks, under General Mischenko,—as daring
a set of cavalrymen as ever existed.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to keep our weather eye open for
those Cossacks,” said Gilbert, while on the march
that evening. “It would be a fine thing if they
should surround us and cut off our retreat.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span></p>

<p>“It will be our own fault if we allow them to do
it,” returned Ben.</p>

<p>The battalion was now perfectly drilled, and each
man could shoot fairly well. Because so many of
the soldiers had been students the command had
been nicknamed the University Corps, and this name
clung to it throughout the entire campaign.
Among the privates and under-officers not only
Gilbert, but also Ben, had made many friends.</p>

<p>No rest was taken until almost daybreak, and then
the battalion went into temporary camp between two
hills, where a dense wood cut off the view from
nearly every side. The spot was practically in the
heart of a Korean forest, with a small stream flowing
silently at the base of the hills. There had been
a footbridge over the stream, but the recent freshet
had carried the timbers away.</p>

<p>All were tired out after a tramp of many miles,
and glad to rest on any sort of bed that came handy.
The place was picketed with care, and then all became
quiet.</p>

<p>Gilbert was resting on a bed of boughs he had had
a coolie cut for him when, from a distance, he heard
a shot, followed by several others in rapid succession.
At once he leaped up, and at the same time an alarm
sounded throughout the whole camp.</p>

<p>“Something is wrong, that is certain,” came from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
Ben, and a few minutes later the companies were
formed. In the meantime a strong guard plunged
into the forest, to learn what the shots meant.</p>

<p>There was an anxious wait, and then it was
learned that a body of sixteen Cossacks on horseback
had appeared on a ridge overlooking the forest.
Unfortunately the Japanese picket in that vicinity
had shown himself, and some of the Cossacks had
fired on him and he had fired in return. Then of a
sudden the Cossacks had disappeared.</p>

<p>It must be confessed that under these circumstances
Major Okopa did not know whether to advance
or retreat. He waited where he was until
night and then made a movement as if to withdraw.
This was only, however, a ruse, and at midnight the
University Corps went forward at a faster pace than
ever.</p>

<p>“We must take some risk, even if we draw on a
regular engagement,” said the major to Gilbert.</p>

<p>“Can’t we send spies ahead, major? That might
save the battalion from trouble.”</p>

<p>“I’ve thought of doing that towards morning.
But I don’t want any detachment to get too far away
from our main body.”</p>

<p>“I see. Well, if you send out spies, I hope you’ll
let me go with them,” continued the ex-lieutenant
of the American regulars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span></p>

<p>“Have you ever done such work before?”</p>

<p>“A little.”</p>

<p>“Then perhaps I’ll let you go, since you desire it.”</p>

<p>Another halt was made at three o’clock in the
morning. They were now at a point where the
road forked, that to the left leading to the mountain
pass, and that on the right to one of the mountain
tops. The trail was a narrow one, hardly fit for
anything but men on foot or horseback.</p>

<p>After a brief discussion it was decided to send out
two detachments, one under Gilbert and another
under Ben. Gilbert was to take the trail leading to
the mountain top and at sunrise get the best view
possible of the situation. Ben was to hunt for the
Cossacks, but not to engage them unless it could not
be helped.</p>

<p>The work just suited Gilbert, and it was not long
before he was on the way, accompanied by eight
men from his company whom he knew he could trust
implicitly.</p>

<p>It was still dark, but the road was a fairly straight
one up the hills and not difficult to follow. The detachment
went in single file, and each man had his
weapon ready for use.</p>

<p>“Do not shoot unless it is necessary,” said Gilbert,
and the men under him knew that the American
officer meant just what he said. Gilbert never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
issued an order twice, consequently his men did not
look for it.</p>

<p>For fully an hour the detachment climbed one hill
and then another. Occasionally they passed the
huts of some Koreans, but if the inhabitants were
anywhere about they did not show themselves.
They knew it would be useless to apply to any of
the natives for information, for whatever might be
told to them could not be relied upon.</p>

<p>Presently they began the ascent of the mountain
proper. Here the trail was more difficult and
progress was, consequently slow. There was a cliff
to pass, narrow and dangerous, and then a series of
rocks around which the trail ran in serpentine
fashion.</p>

<p>So far there had been nothing in the way of an
alarm, but now, from a great distance, came two
shots, followed, after an interval of several minutes,
by half a dozen others. Gilbert at once called a
halt.</p>

<p>“Satmo, what do you think? where did those
shots come from?” he asked of a sharpshooter
trudging behind him.</p>

<p>“That way, captain,” was the answer, in
Japanese, and the soldier pointed with his hand.</p>

<p>“That is what I thought, too. Is it not the direction
taken by Captain Russell and his detachment?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span></p>

<p>“I should say it was, captain.”</p>

<p>“Then he must have met some of the enemy,”
murmured Gilbert, and relapsed into silence.</p>

<p>It was not pleasant for him to think his bosom
friend might be in trouble. But as he could just
then offer no assistance, he ordered his detachment
forward once more, and thus they moved on until
the very summit of the mountain was gained. By
that time all were tired out and glad to rest.</p>

<p>The night had been clear and the day to follow
was equally so. Gilbert had brought with him a
strong pair of field glasses, and with these he surveyed
the scene spread before him with eagerness
and keen interest.</p>

<p>Far to the westward rolled the glistening waters
of the Yellow Sea, while equally distant eastward
were the lofty peaks which form the backbone of
Korea from north to south. Closer was the sparkling
river, and at a distance one settlement and
another, the walls and towers standing out clearly
before the background of houses and huts. To the
northwest was Chong-ju, where it was known the
Cossacks were in force. In that direction Gilbert
looked for a long while.</p>

<p>He had expected to see the encampment under
Major Okopa, but the forest hid this from view, and
not a single soldier of any nationality was in sight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span></p>

<p>“Tell me if you see anything alarming,” said he
to Satmo. “I do not.”</p>

<p>The Japanese sharpshooter took the glasses and
looked around as his captain had ordered. He
shook his head slowly.</p>

<p>“I see nothing of any soldiers——” he began,
and then gave a start. “Yes! There are some
troops, just coming from yonder forest!”</p>

<p>He handed the glasses back to Gilbert, and the
young captain gazed in the direction pointed out.
The sharpshooter was right, a body of Cossacks
numbering at least three hundred had put in an appearance,
all riding rapidly, and in the direction
where the command under Major Okopa had been
left!</p>

<p>“They mean to fight—if they have discovered our
force!” thought Gilbert. “I must warn the major
of this without delay!”</p>

<p>He took another look and now saw another body
of Cossacks approaching but a quarter of a mile behind
the second.</p>

<p>“Our force can never fight that body of cavalry!”
he muttered. “If we were surrounded, they’d cut
us down to a man! We have discovered the enemy
with a vengeance!”</p>

<p>He felt that there had been a blunder somewhere,
but now was no time to speculate upon this. Major<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
Okopa must be warned, and also Ben, and then the
whole of the Japanese detachment must retreat to
some point of safety.</p>

<p>But scarcely had this entered his head when he
remembered something which caused him fresh
alarm. The road the Cossacks were on was the
very one Ben and his detachment had traveled.
Was it possible the detachment had been surprised
and either killed or made prisoners?</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII<br>
<span class="fs80">FACE TO FACE WITH A LEOPARD</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Gilbert spoke to the men under him, and in a
moment more the detachment was on its way down
the mountain side. All realized the peril of the
situation and knew that every minute was precious.
They moved onward as rapidly as the rough trail
allowed, those ahead keeping their eyes on the alert
for the possible appearance of additional danger.</p>

<p>From a great distance came two shots, followed
by a third. No soldiers were to be seen in that
direction, and the young officer concluded that the
shots were meant as a signal.</p>

<p>“Those Cossacks are going to hem us in, if they
can,” he thought. “This is a mess truly.”</p>

<p>With his glasses he mounted another hill, at the
same time ordering his men to move on as before.
He knew he could trust Satmo to conduct the expedition
back into the valley, and he wanted to learn,
if possible, just how many of the Russian cavalry
were in that vicinity.</p>

<p>The way the top of the hill was around a rocky<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
cliff,—that already mentioned. The trail here was
rather dangerous, for the cliff was on one side and a
deep ravine on the other. To make his way up to
the top of the hill quicker, Gilbert dropped part of
his outfit in a convenient place.</p>

<p>In five minutes more the young American had
secured a position where he could see almost as well
as from the mountain top behind him. But, to his
chagrin, all of the Cossacks had disappeared, nor
could he find the least trace of them.</p>

<p>“Perhaps they have discovered we are watching
them,” he reasoned. “I hope they fall back. It
will give us a chance to do likewise.”</p>

<p>Having satisfied himself that nothing could be
gained by remaining at the top of the hill, the young
officer picked his way back to the trail at the point
where it wound round the cliff.</p>

<p>Scarcely had Gilbert reached the trail when he
heard a wild clatter of hoofs coming toward him.
He stopped in surprise, wondering if any of the
Russian cavalrymen were coming that way.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I’d better get out of sight,” he thought,
but ere he could put his plan into execution he saw
the cause of the disturbance. Some pack-horses belonging
to their own train had run away, and were
coming toward him at a furious pace.</p>

<p>Had the trail been wider the young American<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
could have avoided the horses easily. But the foremost
was heavily loaded with boxes, and took up the
entire trail. Behind the first came a second runaway,
the latter having a rope attached to it. A
coolie had hold of the end of the rope, and was yelling
loudly in an endeavor to stop both horses.</p>

<p>Gilbert saw his peril and wondered what he had
best do to save himself. The runaways were bounding
forward at a furious pace, and he realized that it
was out of the question to turn back and outstrip
them, or climb up the cliff before him.</p>

<p>There was no time to think further, for the front
horse was already but a few paces away. He gave
a shout and threw up his hands, but the runaway did
not heed him. Then, as the animal was about to
strike him and knock him down, he made a wild
leap into the ravine below the cliff.</p>

<p>It was a daring thing to do, but not so reckless as
may be imagined. The bottom and the sides of the
ravine were covered with a growth of pine, ash, and
birch, and also some trailing plants, for which Korea
is famous.</p>

</figure>
<br>

<p>Gilbert had noted the top of a particularly dense
pine tree and for this he leaped. By good luck he
struck the tree fairly, coming down among a number
of boughs which were as springy as one could wish.
He clutched at the boughs, and thus stopped his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>progress before striking the rocky ground below.
As he did this the runaways above shot past him, the
coolie and some others of the pack train following.</p>

<p>“Well, that was a narrow escape,” thought the
young captain. “I wonder what made the pack
animals run away?”</p>

<p>Now was no time to speculate on the subject, and
after getting back his wind, he descended to the
ground beneath the tree.</p>

<p>The young American found himself in a dense
forest. The pines predominated, but birches and
ashes were not lacking, and he also noted several
limes, maples, and junipers. Under the tree it was
dark and chilly, and he could not help but shiver.</p>

<p>At first he thought to shout to those on the trail,
but by the time he was in a position to do this not a
soul was in sight.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to find my way back to that trail somehow,”
was his mental observation. “And the
quicker the better.”</p>

<p>The forest was a wild place, which the ax of the
woodman had as yet not disturbed. Consequently
the underbrush was thick and he had all he could do
to make any progress.</p>

<p>It must be admitted that Gilbert did not like the
idea of tramping through that dense growth alone.
He had read up on Korea since joining the army,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
and had been astonished to learn that the mountain
wilds contained such savage beasts as tigers, leopards,
bears, and wildcats, as well as numerous
species of deer and foxes, badgers and martens.
There were also numerous black eagles—he had
already seen many of these—and pheasants, hawks,
herons, magpies, jays, king-fishers, kites, and
orioles.</p>

<p>“I don’t think I’d care to meet a tiger,” was his
thought. “I’m afraid I’d make a poor showing
against such a powerful beast as that.”</p>

<p>As he could not reach the trail he had left so suddenly
by a direct course, he took a circuitous way,
which soon brought him deeper and deeper into the
forest. Then he found himself in a jungle of trailing
vines where further advance was impossible.</p>

<p>“Another mistake!” he groaned, half aloud.
“I reckon I’d better give up being a soldier and go
back to private life.”</p>

<p>There was nothing to do but to turn back, and this
he did without delay. He had scarcely passed along
a distance of three rods when he heard a sound in
the brushwood on his right.</p>

<p>Something was moving there, but what it was he
could not imagine. Coming to a halt, he drew his
pistol and gazed ahead searchingly.</p>

<p>“It must be some wild animal,” he said to himself,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
and the thought had scarcely crossed his mind
when he heard a swish and saw several limbs of a
tree shake violently.</p>

<p>Gilbert was not much of a hunter, but he was
certain that only some beast of good size could
make such a leap and be able to shake the tree limbs
as those before him had been shaken.</p>

<p>If the young captain had been in a quandary on
the trail when the runaway horses were bearing
down upon him, he was even in more of a dilemma
now. He did not care to advance and did not know
if it would be safe to retreat. The beast, whatever
it was, might be watching him, and might pounce
upon him the instant his back was turned.</p>

<p>At last he began to back out, but with his eyes still
fixed upon the tree the limbs of which he had seen
shake. Thus he covered several yards, when he
saw two of the boughs shake once more, and felt by
instinct that the creature, whatever it was, had
leaped into another tree still closer to him.</p>

<p>By this time Gilbert’s heart was beating rapidly.
He felt he had an enemy to face fully as dangerous
as a Cossack sharpshooter. That the beast was
after him there could be no doubt.</p>

<p>He continued to back away, at the same time holding
his pistol in one hand and his sword in the other.
In this fashion he presently came to where a fallen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
tree lay partly concealed in the grass and brushwood.
Almost before he knew it, he tripped on the
tree and went down on his back.</p>

<p>As he fell there was a fierce growl among the
trees before him, and of a sudden a half-grown
leopard crept softly into view, crouching low on a
limb the end of which was within a few feet of the
young American’s head.</p>

<p>Even though he was down on his back Gilbert saw
the beast, and taking quick aim, he fired. At the
same moment the leopard made a wild leap, intending
to land upon the young captain’s breast.</p>

<p>Gilbert’s bullet had been intended for the savage
beast’s right eye, but instead it took the leopard in
the shoulder, inflicting a severe but by no means
mortal wound. The shot made the creature turn
in its course, and it landed close to Gilbert’s feet.</p>

<p>In many a battle the young officer had come to
close quarters, and had thus learned how to turn himself
in an emergency. Agitated though he was, he
kept his presence of mind and as quick as a flash
fired at the leopard a second time, and then a third.
He also brought his sword into play by making a
lunge at the beast’s gleaming teeth. Down came
the teeth with a click on the shining blade, and the
weapon was wrenched from Gilbert’s grasp. But
this brought him to his feet, and once more he fired,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
with his pistol less than two feet from the leopard’s
head.</p>

<p>The last shot was a telling one, and the leopard
rolled over and over, snapping and snarling in a
furious fashion. Then it leaped up and dragged
itself off through the brushwood growling in a
fashion which told that its end could not be far off.</p>

<p>At first Gilbert was inclined to let the beast depart.
But then he thought the leopard might come
back to renew the attack, and leaping into the brushwood,
he quickly fired another shot. This pierced
the beast’s vitals, and leaping into the air, it fell to
the ground, stretched out, and breathed its last.</p>

<p>It was not until the fight was over that Gilbert
realized that he was in a cold perspiration. He felt
a strange weakness at the knees and sank down on a
rock, where he lost no time in reloading the revolver
which had proved such a friend.</p>

<p>“That’s the last time I want to come face to face
with a leopard,” he told himself as he surveyed the
dead creature. “I came out here to fight Russians,
not wild animals.”</p>

<p>Leaving the leopard where it was, he continued
to make his way as best he could toward the cliff.
But the tangle of brushwood appeared as dense at
one point as another, and finally he did not know
which way to turn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span></p>

<p>“I’m in a pickle!” he groaned, half aloud.
“And how to get out is a mystery.”</p>

<p>Finding he could not get close to the cliff, he determined
to pursue a course in the opposite direction,
hoping thereby to gain another trail over the
hills which would take him, sooner or later, to the
main road where he had left Major Okopa’s command.</p>

<p>Five minutes later he found a narrow trail, which
led to the northward. He followed up this trail
for nearly half a mile, when he came within sight
of several native huts. Nobody was around the
huts, and they looked to be deserted.</p>

<p>“The natives must have been scared off by the
war,” he thought, when from one of the huts came
a Cossack cavalryman. The Cossack moved to
another hut, and from this brought forth a horse,
which he proceeded to mount. Soon he was out of
sight down the trail.</p>

<p>The unexpected appearance of the enemy, so close
at hand, perplexed Gilbert and he knew not what to
do next. Then he decided to make an investigation
of all the huts and see if any more Cossacks were
around.</p>

<p>“I’d like to bag some of those fellows,” he reasoned,
and moved forward through some brushwood,
never dreaming of the surprise in store for him.</p>

<span class="fs80">GILBERT MAKES A PRISONER</span></h2>
</div>

<p>One of the Korean huts was close to some bushes
beside the trail, and the young captain had but little
difficulty in approaching it without laying himself
liable to being seen by any others of the enemy who
might be near at hand.</p>

<p>This hut contained two horses, and he rightfully
surmised by this that two more Cossacks must be in
that vicinity.</p>

<p>Crawling between that hut and the next, he heard
a murmur of voices. It came from the last hut
of the row. The Cossacks were talking in their
own dialect, and what was being said the young
American could not make out.</p>

<p>Feeling the second hut must be vacant, Gilbert
slipped into this. He had his pistol in his hand, and
his sword where he could bring it into play at a
moment’s notice.</p>

<p>The murmur of voices now came clearer, and
presently Gilbert heard another voice. Much to his
amazement this last voice was speaking in English!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t understand such jargon,” was what was
said. “Can’t you talk United States?”</p>

<p>“Ben Russell, as sure as fate,” said Gilbert
to himself. “Now how in creation did he get
here?”</p>

<p>There could be but one answer to this question—Ben
had been captured, just as he had before feared.
More than likely the men of his detachment were
also prisoners, or else shot down.</p>

<p>“I must save Ben, no matter at what cost,” Gilbert
told himself. The idea of deserting his old
chum never once entered his head.</p>

<p>Watching his opportunity, the young captain left
the hut he had entered, and slipped to the rear of
that in which were the Cossacks and their prisoner.
Gazing through a slit Gilbert saw Ben, with his
hands tied behind him, sitting on a small bench,
while before him, with sabers drawn, stood two
burly cavalrymen. Their faces were dark and forbidding,
and they looked as if they considered that
the American had no rights which they were bound
to respect. As a matter of fact, it enraged them
greatly to learn that an American would dare throw
in his fortunes with those fighting under the
Mikado’s flag.</p>

<p>From where he stood, Gilbert could have fired
point-blank at the Cossacks and likely killed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
pair on the spot. But he had no desire to shed
blood in such a reckless fashion, even though his
chum was a prisoner. He determined to watch for
a favorable opportunity when he might dash in and
give Ben his freedom.</p>

<p>The chance was not long in coming. Having
talked for a minute between themselves, one of the
Cossacks stepped out of the hut, and hurried to his
horse. Soon he was off, going in the same direction
the first cavalryman had taken.</p>

<p>Without hesitation, Gilbert now stepped to the
front of the hut. He covered the Cossack inside
with his pistol.</p>

<p>“Gilbert!” ejaculated Ben, in glad surprise.
“Well, this is lucky, to say the least.”</p>

<p>At these words, and at the shadow behind him,
the Cossack swung around quickly. When he saw
the young captain and the gleaming barrel of the
pistol, his face fell and he muttered a loud exclamation
which Gilbert did not understand.</p>

<p>“Throw up your hands!” said the young American,
in Russian.</p>

<p>The hands went up slowly, one still holding the
saber, which the Cossack was itching to use.</p>

<p>“Drop that saber!” was Gilbert’s next order.
“Drop it at once!”</p>

<p>Again the cavalryman hesitated. But he did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
like the look in the young American’s eye, and with
a clatter the blade fell to the floor of the hut.</p>

<p>The young captain next compelled the Cossack
to march into a corner, facing the angle. Then, as
Ben backed up to him, Gilbert cut the cord which
bound his hands together.</p>

<p>“Good for you Gilbert,” cried Ben, as he picked
up the saber. “You certainly got here in the nick
of time. Are your men outside?”</p>

<p>At this Gilbert shook his head. “I’m alone,” he
said. “But I shouldn’t like to have that fellow
know it.”</p>

<p>“What became of your men?”</p>

<p>“They started to return to the main body of our
command. What of yours?”</p>

<p>“We fell in with some of the Cossacks and had a
pretty warm fight for a few minutes. Then most of
my men fled. I was surrounded and captured, and
three of the Cossacks brought me here. I think
they take me for a spy.”</p>

<p>No time was lost after this in tying the hands of
the Cossack in the corner. Then Gilbert asked the
fellow a number of questions in Russian, but got
little satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Why not search him?” suggested Ben, and this
was done. The prisoner objected roundly, but it
was of no avail. In an inner pocket was found a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
map of the mountains and trails, and some sort of
an order written in Russia.</p>

<p>“I believe this chap is a spy!” cried Gilbert.
“We must take him back to the Japanese camp by
all means.”</p>

<p>“Easy enough to say, Gilbert. But you must
remember that these hills are full of the enemy.”</p>

<p>“We must watch our chances.”</p>

<p>Both deemed it unsafe to remain at the huts, and a
little later they moved off, taking the cavalryman’s
horse with them.</p>

<p>Gilbert and Ben took turns in riding, the one on
foot keeping watch on the Cossack so that he might
not attempt to run away.</p>

<p>For once fortune favored them, for scarcely had
they covered a mile when they came to a much
broader trail. At a distance they heard voices, and
soon came in sight of some of their own pack train,
while ahead was Major Okopa’s command, hurrying
along on the double-quick, to get out of the reach of
the Cossacks.</p>

<p>“Is it possible!” exclaimed the major when he
caught sight of the two Americans. “Where have
you been, and how does it happen that you are
together?”</p>

<p>“It’s a long story, major,” answered Gilbert.
“See, we have a prisoner. We think he is a spy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
We took these from him.” And the young captain
showed the map and paper.</p>

<p>The Japanese major was keenly interested, and
took possession of the documents. The Cossack was
turned over to a detail, and the solders were cautioned
to watch him closely, which they did.</p>

<p>Gilbert soon found that his men under Satmo had
rejoined the main body without mishap, and that
the runaway horses had been brought in after a most
exciting chase by the hostlers and coolies. Of Ben’s
detachment all but one man was on hand. The
missing man came into camp twenty-four hours
later.</p>

<p>Major Okopa had now learned all that he had set
out to ascertain and, as a consequence, no time was
lost in falling back to where the main body of the
Japanese army lay.</p>

<p>His trying experience at the cliff, and afterward,
had worn Gilbert out, and he was glad enough to
rest for several days after the regular camp was
reached. During that time the Cossack brought in
was examined. Fortunately for him, it could not be
proved that he was spy—in which case he would
have been shot—so he was placed among the ordinary
prisoners, much to his satisfaction. Gilbert
was congratulated on securing the man so cleverly
and also on having aided Ben to escape.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span></p>

<p>Owing to the spring thaws the roads were now
all but impassable, and before the Japanese army as
a whole could move forward towards the Yalu a
large portion of the roadbed had to be repaired. For
the heavy artillery logs had to be laid, and day after
day the engineering corps were kept busy, bringing
in logs from the surrounding forests.</p>

<p>The middle of March found our friends located
at An-ju, on the highway leading to Chong-ju.
More troops were coming to the front rapidly, and
it was rumored that the Russians were massing at
the last-named point. On the 28th there was a
small engagement, which resulted in a score being
killed or wounded, on either side. As the Japanese
pushed more troops to the front the Russians retired
to Wiju and other points close to the southern bank
of the Yalu. But even these points could not be
held by them, and then they began to mass on the
northern bank of the river, where they determined to
offer a stubborn resistance to all further Japanese
progress.</p>

<p>“This is going to be a war on a large scale after
all,” observed Gilbert, as he watched some new regiments
coming in. “We must have forty or fifty
thousand men here already.”</p>

<p>“The Japanese realize that they have no small
nation to deal with,” answered another officer, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
stood near. “They know that Russia can put as
large an army in the field as any country in the
world.”</p>

<p>“There is going to be a hard fight when it comes
to crossing the Yalu,” put in Ben. “I’ll wager the
Russians will contest every inch of the way,” and in
that surmise he was correct.</p>

<p>After the enemy had been driven to the northern
bank of the stream, General Kuroki planted his left
flank near the mouth of the Yalu, and spread out his
right to a distance of almost twenty-five miles up the
stream. Heavy artillery was brought up and located
where it was thought it could do the most good
(or rather, the most damage), and many advantageous
positions were strongly fortified. In addition
materials for pontoon bridges were also carried forward,
so that at the proper moment there would be
no delay in getting across the Yalu—all providing
the Russians would permit such a move.</p>

<p>While such work was going forward on the
Japanese side the enemy was equally busy, hurrying
soldiers to the scene, and bringing up guns just as
heavy as their opponents. It is estimated that the
Russians had about thirty thousand men in the
vicinity of the Yalu. A large force was stationed
at Antung and another at Yung-tien, and troops
were also located as far to the northeast as Kuantien.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
The Korean road and gate were particularly
well guarded, and spies were sent out constantly to
inform the Russian commanders when an attack
might be expected. But the Japanese, well known
for their secrecy, kept their plans to themselves, so
that, finally, the opening of the great battle of the
Yalu came to the Russians largely in the nature of a
surprise.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX<br>
<span class="fs80">THE SINKING OF THE “PETROPAVLOVSKI”</span></h2>
</div>

<p>While the Japanese troops in Korea were preparing
to attack the Russians at the Yalu River news
came to the front of the destruction of a large warship
stationed in Port Arthur harbor.</p>

<p>This was the Russian battleship <em>Petropavlovski</em>,
the flagship of Admiral Makaroff. She was
one of the largest ships in the Russian navy and
carried between seven hundred and eight hundred
men.</p>

<p>The destruction of this magnificent vessel came
about in rather a peculiar manner. For a long while
the Russian fleet had remained in the harbor at Port
Arthur, refusing to come out and fight the Japanese
fleet on the high seas, away from the protection of
the land batteries.</p>

<p>As a ruse the Japanese admiral sent forward, one
misty morning, a small squadron of fighting ships of
the second class, which began a vigorous but rather
useless bombardment. In the meantime the big
Japanese battleships kept entirely out of sight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span></p>

<p>Seeing no ships but the little ones, the Russian
admiral lost no time in going forth to meet the
enemy. At once the Japanese warships retreated,
but did it so slowly that the Russian ships were led
on and on, until they were about fifteen miles out to
sea. As soon as this was accomplished a wireless
message to the big Japanese ships was forwarded,
and they at once put on all steam, to get behind the
enemy, and thus cut the Russians off from the harbor,
in which case they would no longer have the aid
of the land batteries, and would have to face, in the
open sea, a force considerably larger than their
own.</p>

<p>The plan was well laid and would have succeeded
had it not been for a sudden change in the weather.
Quite unexpectedly a stiff breeze sprang up, blowing
the mist away. As soon as the sun began to
peep through the clouds the Japanese warships trying
to get behind the Russians were discovered, and
Admiral Makaroff at once signaled to his fleet to
return to the harbor with all speed.</p>

<p>Disappointed at being unable to surround his
enemy, Admiral Togo put on all steam and went in
pursuit and then began a chase such as has not been
seen since Admiral Cervera was followed by our
own warships from out of Santiago harbor. Back
for Port Arthur went the Russian vessel, battleships,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
cruisers, and all, steaming as they had never
steamed before.</p>

<p>In coming out of the harbor the Russian ships had
carefully avoided the numerous mines planted there.
But they knew little about the Japanese torpedoes
placed to do them harm, and without warning the
<em>Petropavlovski</em> came upon one of these.</p>

<p>A dull report was heard, and a great cloud of
greenish-white water and smoke arose in the air.
Then, as the big battleship was seen to lurch to one
side, came another report, louder than the first, and
once more the water flew in all directions, while this
time a heavy cloud of black smoke arose in the air,
mingled with wreckage and the forms of officers and
sailors.</p>

<p>An instant later the battleship gave another
lurch, swayed unsteadily for a moment, and then
burst into flames from stem to stern. As the horrified
onlookers gazed at the spectacle the ship swayed
again, turned over on her side, and then, with a
strange hissing and roaring, disappeared beneath the
waves, carrying her gallant admiral and over six
hundred officers and sailors with her.</p>

<p>For the time being there was utter confusion in
the Russian squadron and the other vessels scarcely
knew what to do. One ship, the <em>Poltava</em>, put out
several small boats and succeeded in saving seven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
officers, seventy-three sailors, and also the Grand
Duke Cyril, who chanced to be on board.</p>

<p>The Russian squadron was now close to a place
of safety, but their troubles were not yet over.
Only a few minutes later, a mine exploded close to
the side of the <em>Pobieda</em>, tearing a great hole in the
battleship. But as good fortune would have it, this
explosion failed to set off any of the magazines, as
had been the case with the flagship, and with her
bulkheads tightly closed, the crippled vessel managed
to get to her anchorage without further mishaps.</p>

<p>The loss of the great battleship <em>Petropavlovski</em>
was a great blow to Russia, and when the news of
the disaster reached that country everybody went
into mourning. Many officers of reputation happened
to be on board of the ship when she sank, and
some of the bodies have never been recovered. It
may be mentioned here that the battleship also had
on board the famous Russian artist, Verestchagin,
well known the world over for his war paintings.
Just before the first explosion came he was seen on
the deck, sketch-book in hand, making a pencil
drawing. It was his last bit of work, for he went
down with the ship.</p>

<p>“That must have been a horrible sight,” said
Gilbert, to Ben, when they were discussing this bit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
of news. “Think of the hundreds of officers and
sailors that were drowned.”</p>

<p>“It puts me in mind of the sinking of our
battleship <em>Maine</em>, in Havana harbor,” returned
Ben.</p>

<p>“Somehow, the Russians don’t seem to be able
to do a thing on the water,” went on Gilbert.
“They have sunk or disabled a few small Japanese
ships, but that is all, while they have lost some of the
very best warships they possessed.”</p>

<p>“I take it that the Japanese gunners are well
trained, Gilbert. They have sent their young naval
officers to America and to Europe to learn all they
possibly could, and being ambitious to make a record
they are doing their level best—while the Russians
seem to be satisfied to rest on laurels gained years
ago. If the Czar wants to do anything he has got
to wake up.”</p>

<p>“I see the Japanese warships are keeping right
at Port Arthur. The bombardments must be something
terrific.”</p>

<p>“No doubt they are. More than likely some of
the residents of that town wish they were out of it.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to know what has become of that Captain
Barusky and Ivan Snokoff.”</p>

<p>“Barusky likely has his hands full at the port.
A sneak like Snokoff will probably keep as far from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
danger as he can. Such rascals have no use for
fighting.”</p>

<p>Early the following morning Major Okopa’s command
moved forward once more, along with over
four thousand of the Japanese troops, infantry and
artillery. It was an inspiring sight, and despite the
bad weather that had been experienced, and the
awful condition of the roads, the majority of the
troops were in good spirits.</p>

<p>“This is like a touch of old times in the Philippines,”
observed Gilbert, as the command swung
along through a side road, cut through a heavy
forest. “The jungle isn’t quite as bad, but it is
bad enough.”</p>

<p>“Wonder how soon we’ll get to some real fighting,”
came from Ben.</p>

<p>“Perhaps before we know it,” answered his
chum.</p>

<p>Gilbert was right—the fighting came that very
day, just before sundown. Shots were heard ahead,
and soon the advance guard came running back with
the news that a Russian regiment had taken a stand
on a small hill half a mile away.</p>

<p>This news acted like magic on the Japanese
soldiers. As tired as they were from the day’s
tramp, and despite the fact that they had had only a
lunch at midday, and wanted their suppers, they set<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
up a ringing shout, in which the young American
officers readily joined.</p>

<p>“Forward!” was the cry, in Japanese, and forward
went one command after another, Major
Okopa’s battalion with the rest. The latter was
ordered to move to the left, where some timber had
been cut down the season before, leaving a field that
was about half cleared and one studded with stumps
and rocks.</p>

<p>“I see the Russians!” yelled Gilbert presently,
and he was right. Almost at the same moment the
enemy opened fire, and two of the University Corps
went down badly wounded.</p>

<p>It was the “baptism of fire,” as it is called by old
soldiers, but the corps stood the shock well. Without
wavering it swept along, among the stumps and
rocks until the order came to halt and lie down.
From this position volley after volley was discharged
at the Russian infantry, which was lodged
behind a row of trees at the edge of a thick patch of
timber.</p>

<p>“They’ve got an advantage over us,” said Gilbert.
“Those trees are a great protection.”</p>

<p>“Wait until Koshama’s battery gets here,”
answered Major Okopa. “It will make a hornet’s
nest of the woods for them.”</p>

<p>The battery was already in position, and soon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
one of the guns was brought into play. The havoc
along the edge of the timber patch was terrific, and
in consternation the Russians fled.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! they are retreating!” shouted Ben, and
leaped up, as did all those around him. Once more
the Japanese soldiers swept forward and in a few
minutes were as deep into the forest as were the
Russians. Here something of a hand-to-hand encounter
took place, lasting probably fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>By this time Gilbert’s fighting blood was
thoroughly aroused and with dreams of victories
won in Cuba, Luzon, and in China, he rushed forward,
sword in one hand and pistol in the other.
Scarcely had he covered a distance of fifty yards
when he found himself in the midst of the battle,
with several Russians directly in front of him.</p>

<p>It was a moment of peril and nobody could have
realized it better than did the young American captain.
He discharged his pistol point-blank at one
of the Russians and saw the fellow go down with a
wound in his side. Then a gun was discharged
close to his ear, the bullet fairly clipping his hair.
He turned and with his sword made a lunge at the
shooter, giving him a slight wound in the shoulder.
As he did so one of his own men leaped to the front
and shot the Russian through the throat killing him
instantly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span></p>

<p>The battle was now a hot one on all sides. But
the Russians knew they could not hold their ground,
and they began slowly to retreat over the top of a
hill, where, some days before they had had a battery
planted. But orders had come to take the battery
to the north side of the Yalu, and this order had been
obeyed. There was some confusion, and in one
instance twenty Russians were surrounded and
taken prisoners. On the other hand six Japanese
were killed and ten badly wounded.</p>

<p>Near the end of the engagement Gilbert found
himself at the edge of a small brook which, some
miles away, flowed into the Yalu. Ben’s command
was not far away, and both young Americans
were fighting almost side by side. It was growing
dark, so the enemy could be seen only with
difficulty.</p>

<p>“Wonder how long this is going to last?” Gilbert
asked himself. “We shall have to call it off
pretty soon.”</p>

<p>These thoughts had just crossed his mind, when
without previous warning, three Russian soldiers
came at him in a bunch.</p>

<p>“There is the American!” shouted one, in his
native tongue. “Down with him! Such as he has
no right to fight with the Japanese!”</p>

<p>A shot was fired, and Gilbert felt himself struck<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
lightly in the left arm. Another shot whistled past
his face. He tried to dodge to one side, but hitting
a rock, stumbled and fell. Then a Russian lieutenant
saw his plight and leaped forward, sword in
hand, to run him through and through.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE BATTLE OF THE YALU</span></h2>
</div>

<p>For the instant after he went down, Gilbert was
too bewildered to do anything to save himself. The
Russian lieutenant was so close the young American
had no chance to dodge or roll out of the way.</p>

<p>But when the young captain was attacked by the
three Russian privates, Ben saw the movement and
lost no time in hurrying to his chum’s assistance.
He was just in time to meet the onslaught of the
Russian lieutenant, and sword met sword in a clash
which drew fire from both blades.</p>

<p>“Not so fast, my fine fellow!” cried Ben, who,
as my old readers know, knew how to handle his
blade perfectly. “Not so fast!” And watching his
chance, he gave a turn that sent the Russian’s blade
flying into the air. Then he lunged at his enemy,
but the fellow was too quick for him, and leaping
back, he lost no time in taking to his heels and disappearing
among the trees.</p>

<p>“Good for you, Ben,” panted Gilbert, as he leaped
up. “You stopped him just in the nick of time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span></p>

<p>“Glad I was able to do it,” was the laconic
reply. “They thought they had you sure, didn’t
they?”</p>

<p>The battle was now on the wane, and a little later
the Russians were in full retreat. The Japanese
thought at first to follow them up, but were too
tired and hungry to do so. The Russians lost no
time in reaching the Yalu, and that night, under
cover of darkness, made their way by one of the
fords to the other side.</p>

<p>Following this battle—which, indeed, was little
more than a brisk skirmish,—came several other
encounters in that vicinity, in which, however, our
friends did not participate. Meanwhile the Japanese
general lost no time in massing his forces along the
Yalu, as previously mentioned, bringing up his batteries
to the most commanding positions, and
making all in readiness for a battle which both sides
knew would be long and bloody.</p>

<p>To understand the great battle so close at hand,
it is necessary for a moment to look at the geography
of the locality. The Yalu is a broad and rather
shallow stream, bounded in some places by hills and
in others by low, marshy land. Opposite to the
town of Wiju, is the Manchurian river Ai, above
which is a high spur of land called Husan, or Tiger
Hill. Between this spur and the Korean side of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
Yalu is Kulido Island, and there is a ford to this
island from each side of the river.</p>

<p>Some distance below where the Ai joins the Yalu
the main river is cut into three channels by two
islands, each about thirteen miles long. There are
fords to both islands, but they are deep and dangerous,
while the middle channel of the river can only
be crossed by means of a bridge.</p>

<p>Following several skirmishes of slight importance,
came a sharp attack by the Japanese on some Russian
sharpshooters located on Kulido Island. This
was at dawn on the 26th of April, and the Russians
replied with vigor. But the Japanese fire proved
too heavy for them, and presently they retreated to
the mainland, being shelled by a battery located on
a hill behind Wiju.</p>

<p>This was an opening the Japanese were looking
for, and in a twinkling some boats were brought
forth, and the troops either rowed or waded to the
island. It may be mentioned here that among the
troops to move to this new position were the sharpshooters
to which Dan Casey and Carl Stummer
belonged, and both distinguished themselves by what
they did upon that occasion.</p>

<p>No sooner was the island in the possession of the
Japanese than the Russians tried to retake it. But
the fire of the Japanese battery was too fierce for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
them, and at last they were compelled to retreat to a
shelter under Tiger Hill.</p>

<p>While this fighting was going on to the north of
Wiju, another division of the Japanese army crossed
the two islands further down, and made preparations
to cross from the second island to the north
bank of the Yalu. Strange as it may seem, the engagement
at this point was a small one and the
losses were trifling on both sides.</p>

<p>The next day was given over largely to bridge-building
by the Japanese. The Russians watched
them closely, and did what they could to stop the
work, but without success. The batteries on both
sides were kept at work, and the Japanese fire was so
destructive that the enemy was forced to keep back.
In the meantime a large body of the Japanese army
was marched far to the north of Wiju, and the next
day constructed two pontoon bridges across the Yalu,
and succeeded in landing on the north bank. With
this division went the command to which Gilbert and
Ben were attached.</p>

<p>It had been thought all along that the Russians
would make a strong resistance at Tiger Hill, but
much to the astonishment of the Japanese when they
arrived there they found it deserted. This was due
to a misunderstanding of orders among the Russians,
for the next day they took command of the hill, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
Japanese being just then in no position to drive them
away.</p>

<p>It was now that the Japanese showed their skill
in generalship. Totally ignorant of the fact that a
strong portion of the Japanese army was creeping
up upon his left, the Russian commander at Tiger
Hill began an engagement with the Japanese body on
Kulido Island, directly in front of him. Slowly,
but surely, the division from the north crept closer,
coming over first one hill and then another. At last
it came into sight unexpectedly, and that fact was
announced throughout the Russian quarters.</p>

<p>“The advance must be stopped, and at once,” was
the order given, and the heavy artillery broke forth
into a roar to be heard for miles, while the shrapnel
whistled through the air in all directions. The
Japanese batteries, now able to locate the field-pieces
of the enemy by the smoke, also broke forth, until
the din was terrific. By those who took part in this
battle, a hillside was described as a perfect volcano,
from which belched forth gray-black smoke and
grim death.</p>

<p>In this great struggle the red banners of the
Mikado’s men were ever in the front—for Japanese
armies invariably carry their flags where they should
be carried, in the advance guard. This flag cheered
the soldiers on to deeds of great valor, helping them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
to cross the river at the two islands and in other
places in the face of a fire that was as searching now
as it had been uncertain in the days previous. The
slaughter on every side was fearful, but as soon as
one line melted away another sprang forward to take
its place.</p>

<p>Neither Gilbert nor Ben got into the fight until
about eleven o’clock in the morning. They had
crossed the pontoon bridge nearest to Wiju with
Major Okopa’s command, and were marching along
over the hills in the direction of Tiger Hill.</p>

<p>“The battle is on now for certain,” exclaimed
Gilbert, as he listened to the thunder of artillery in
the distance.</p>

<p>“I hope it is going in our favor,” answered Ben,
who had chanced to come up. “My, just listen to
that,” he went on, as the din became heavier than
ever.</p>

<p>“Sounds as if both sides had every battery into
play,” went on Gilbert.</p>

<p>Soon after this they were ordered to move forward
on the double-quick. Away went the soldiers, each
carrying his heavy baggage and his gun as if they
weighed nothing at all.</p>

<p>The battalion had been discovered by a Russian
battery, and soon came some shells which did considerable
damage. They could not reply to this, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
kept on, until a grove of trees gave them temporary
relief. Their course was now almost directly for
Tiger Hill.</p>

<p>The shock of battle to follow was probably the
heaviest that the young Americans had ever experienced.
At first they had the Russian batteries to
overcome, and then they found themselves face to
face with several Russian regiments well-known for
their heroism and soldierly qualities. It was a fight
“to the finish,” as Ben afterward expressed it, and
every foot of the ground was contested.</p>

<p>“Phew! but this is fighting,” declared Gilbert,
after they had been at it for hours. “Talk
about getting into close quarters. If we are beaten,
we’ll be caught like rats in a trap.”</p>

<p>“But we are not going to be beaten, Gilbert,”
answered his chum. “Just listen to that.”</p>

<p>Close at hand a Japanese regiment was fighting
desperately. The flags were to the front, and each
soldier was yelling “<em>Banzai!</em>” at the top of his
lungs. They had often shouted that word themselves,
for <em>Banzai</em> is the Japanese for hurrah.</p>

<p>They were now going up Tiger Hill proper. On
all sides the shells were dropping, and the hillside
was thick with smoke and with the bodies of the
dead and the wounded. The sight was enough to
sicken them, but they did not dare to give it a second<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
thought. They must do or die, that was all there
was to it.</p>

<p>“Forward—for the honor of Japan!” was the
Japanese cry. “Forward for the Mikado!” And
forward they did go, up one rocky slope after
another. And while this advance was being made, a
Japanese flotilla of gunboats steamed up the Yalu as
far as Antung, shelling that town and also several
other Russian strongholds.</p>

<p>Pressed from in front and on both sides, the Russian
commander at Tiger Hill knew not what to do,
and was gradually forced to retreat, which he did
by crossing the Ai River not far above where that
stream flows into the Yalu. Here were some hills,
and he lost no time in fortifying them as best he
could. It is said that he wished to retreat still further,
but his superiors would not allow him to do so.</p>

<p>The attack on Tiger Hill had occurred on Saturday,
and that night it is safe to say nearly all of the
soldiers on both sides were all but exhausted. Gilbert
and Ben could scarcely stand, and the same was
true of Major Okopa.</p>

<p>“I wonder if we’ll have to fight to-morrow,” said
Ben, as they sat eating a very late supper.</p>

<p>“To be sure,” answered Gilbert. “Now we’ve got
the Russians on the run it would be most unwise to
let them rest.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span></p>

<p>“It’s wonderful what our men can endure. Even
the students seem to have iron constitutions.”</p>

<p>There was little sleep that night, and by dawn
the call to arms was renewed. The command had
been resting close to the top of Tiger Hill. Now it
was ordered to take its place with the advance across
the Ai River, which was to be forded in the face of
the foe intrenched on the opposite shore.</p>

<p>The troops which had crossed by way of Kulido
Island were close at hand, and just before the march
to the river started Gilbert and Ben heard a call in a
familiar voice, and beheld Dan Casey running
towards them.</p>

<p>“Well, av all things,” cried the Irish sharpshooter,
as he shook hands. “Sure an’ I didn’t expect
to mate you in such a shpot as this!”</p>

<p>“How have you been, Casey?” questioned Gilbert.</p>

<p>“First-rate, barrin’ a scratch I got from a
shell yesterday.” The Irishman’s eyes twinkled.
“Sure an’ it was a regular Donnybrook fair, wasn’t
it?”</p>

<p>“I should say it was—three Donnybrooks rolled
into one,” laughed Ben. “But where is Stummer?
Gilbert said he was with you.”</p>

<p>“Here he comes now,” was the reply, and a
moment later the German sharpshooter came up and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
almost hugged Ben, and then shook hands with Gilbert.</p>

<p>“I dink me you vos not go py der var after all,”
he said to Gilbert. “So you vos captains, hey? I
vos glad to hear dot. Maype you ton’t vos fightin’
a leetle yesterday alretty? I told Tan it vos a hornet’s
nest—chust like dot pattle of San Juan Hill py
Cuby.”</p>

<p>“Were you touched, Carl?”</p>

<p>“Yah, but I ton’t know it bis der pattle vos ofer.
Den I see plood running mine leg town, und I got
me shot chust ofer der knee. But it vos noddings und
I ton’t go to no doctor. Tan, he pound it up for
me,” concluded Carl Stummer; and there the talk
had to come to an end.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII<br>
<span class="fs80">CROSSING THE RIVER</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Despite the fact that there had been some hand-to-hand
conflicts, the great battle of the Yalu had so
far been largely one of artillery. Many batteries
had been brought into play, and fearful execution
had been rendered, both on the islands and on either
side of the broad river and near the mouth of the Ai.</p>

<p>But now this was to be changed. Just in front
of Tiger Hill rested four miles of Japanese soldiers,
awaiting the order to ford the stream as best they
could, and storm the Russian position before them.
Other soldiers were on the islands, also in readiness
to cross. This was on Sunday morning, May 1,
1904,—a date well worth remembering.</p>

<p>Before dawn the Japanese commander-in-chief
had everything in readiness for the advance. The
soldiers were close to the water front, but screened
from view by low hills and small patches of timber.</p>

<p>“Forward,” came the command for Major
Okopa’s battalion, about seven o’clock, and in less
than a minute they were on the move. As luck<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
would have it, they were placed next to the sharpshooters
to which Casey and Stummer belonged,
and the two commands started to cross the Ai less
than a hundred feet apart.</p>

<p>The Japanese batteries had already “opened the
ball,” as Ben termed it, doing their best to disclose
the batteries of the enemy. But General Kashtalinsky
had learned a lesson the day before, and did
not allow a shot to be fired in return until the troops
of the Mikado absolutely compelled him to do so.
Then his batteries roared forth as never before,
doing execution that was frightful in the extreme.</p>

<p>The advance of the Japanese to the water’s edge
was in open-front order. But the fords were narrow,
and as a consequence the infantry had to bunch
up the instant they entered the stream. They now
formed an excellent target for the Russians behind
the hills of the other shore, and man after man
dropped, as bullets and shrapnel came whistling in
that direction. But the advance was not checked,
those in the rear fairly pushing those in front ahead.
As the batteries of the Mikado had now discovered
the position of the enemy’s guns, they did all they
could to silence the pieces. This bombardment was
deafening and created a great smoke which swept
along the river like a pall.</p>

<p>Along with their commands, Gilbert and Ben<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
plunged into the stream, which at some points in
the fords was waist-deep. The footing was slippery,
and they had to be careful to keep from going down.
Some did fall, among them Carl Stummer, who
struck on his back with a loud splash and then disappeared
for a second.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Cart, are ye hit?” sang out Dan Casey,
who was close by.</p>

<p>“No, I ton’t vos hit,” spluttered the German sharpshooter.
“Put I got me apout a gallon of vater in
alretty! Of I known der rifer vos so schlippery, I
but me sbikes mine shoes in, hey?”</p>

<p>“’Twouldn’t be a bad idea,” answered Casey,
with a grin. “But come on, onless ye want to be lift
behind,” and forward he raced, to rejoin those who
had plunged ahead.</p>

<p>As the infantry gained the middle of the stream
the fire of the Russians became hotter than ever.
Soldiers went down by the score, some few killed
and the rest wounded. Of the latter, sad to relate,
many were drowned before they could be picked up.</p>

<p>As Gilbert plunged on, he and his command drew
closer to the sharpshooters who were following Dan
Casey. The gallant Irishman was shouting and
hurrahing wildly, and waving his hand for the others
to hurry up.</p>

<p>“Come, b’ys, come,” he called, regardless of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
fact that nearly all the Japanese understood not a
word of what he said. “Come, I tell ye! Be th’
first to make the Roossians run an’ win a medal!
Don’t be after actin’ like ye had lead in yer feet!
<em>Banzai!</em>”</p>

<p>The last word was understood, and “<em>Banzai</em>,”
ran all along the line. The Irishman was well liked
by all who knew him, and his courageous spirit made
those around him press forward more eagerly than
ever.</p>

<p>Like Stummer, Ben had slipped in the water, and
this placed him a little behind Gilbert. The latter
and Casey were almost side by side,—each in water
up to his waist.</p>

<p>Suddenly Gilbert saw the Irishman throw up both
hands and clutch at the air. His heart almost
stopped beating, for he knew that such a movement
could mean but one thing—that Casey had been
wounded. Then he saw the Irishman pitch headlong
into the stream and disappear.</p>

<p>“Dan,” he called, and at that moment he realized
how much he thought of this comrade of so many
fights. He plunged forward and felt around in the
stream. Bullets were whistling all around him, but
to these he just then paid no attention. If Casey
was still alive, he felt he must do all in his power to
save him from drowning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span></p>

<p>At last he got hold of the Irish sharpshooter, and
with a strong effort he raised his wounded comrade
from the water. The poor fellow was breathing
heavily and spluttering.</p>

<p>“Where are you hit, Dan?” he asked quickly.</p>

<p>“In th—the side. Oh!” And then Casey closed
his eyes and went off into a faint.</p>

<p>For the moment Gilbert did not know what to do;
the next he had his comrade of many fights over his
shoulder, and was rushing forward as fast as
before. Luckily the shore was not far away, and
in a few minutes he gained the shelter of some
brushwood, just as Carl Stummer came after
him.</p>

<p>“Vat’s der madder mit Tan?”</p>

<p>“He is wounded, Carl. Come, let us see if we
can’t do something for him.”</p>

<p>An examination revealed the fact that Casey had
received a bullet through his right side. Gilbert was
no surgeon, but experience told him that while the
hurt was bad enough it would probably not be fatal.
He tore off the sleeve of his shirt for a bandage, and
bound up the wound as well as his limited means
permitted, Stummer assisting.</p>

<p>“Can you look after him now, Carl? I must rejoin
my company, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Yah, I look after him,” answered the German<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
sharpshooter “Poor Tan! and he vos vonts to fight
so pad, too.”</p>

<p>“Fortunes of war,” returned Gilbert laconically;
and then he ran off at top speed, in the direction
Major Okopa’s command had taken.</p>

<p>He found the battalion fighting desperately. They
were moving up a long hill, at the top of which was
planted a Russian battery. To the left was a long
line of intrenchments, filled with Russian soldiers,
and bullets and shells were whistling and screaming
through the air as thickly as ever.</p>

<p>Had the infantry been compelled to face what was
before them unaided, the Japanese victory might not
have been so complete. But the Japanese batteries
had now located the Russian intrenchments, and
shells and shrapnel were poured into them, turning
them into veritable slaughter pens. But from these
same intrenchments the enemy fired steadily on the
advancing sons of Nippon, and many a red banner
went down in the dust and smoke.</p>

<p>At last Gilbert and Ben found themselves close
together once more. The companies were climbing
from rock to rock up the long slope, utilizing every
shelter as best they could. All around them the
battle continued, up and down and across the river.</p>

<p>“Hurrah, the Russians are retreating!” was the
cry of the Japanese, about ten o’clock. The news<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
proved true, some of the batteries and infantry were
moving back to Hon-mu-tang, on the road to Feng-wang-cheng.</p>

<p>The fact that the enemy was falling back was
hailed with savage delight by the Japanese, and forward
they went with vigor, charging over the
wide plain behind the hill. Here occurred some
bloody hand-to-hand conflicts, and one Russian regiment,
the Eleventh Siberian, was almost surrounded
and captured. But a priest who chanced to be
along ordered a bayonet charge, and led the way to
safety by running ahead holding aloft a crucifix.</p>

<p>Antung had been abandoned, the Russians setting
fire to the town before leaving, and now Kiu-lien-cheng
was likewise evacuated. Re-enforcements
were expected by the soldiers of the Czar, but they
did not come up in time to be of use in stemming
the sweeping advance of the Japanese.</p>

<p>It was now that Gilbert and Ben fully realized
what the Japanese soldiers could do when put to it.
They fought like very demons and never seemed
to grow weary of charging and of using either gun
or bayonet. Many were without ammunition, but
to this they gave scant attention. Those who were
wounded but slightly still kept at the struggle, with
blood pouring from their faces and bodies. They
were fighting for their beloved Mikado and fair<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
Nippon, and to die would be glory. Never once,
even under the heaviest fire, did they think of retreating.</p>

<p>“We haven’t learned the meaning of that word,”
said Major Okopa grimly, to Gilbert, as he wiped
the sweat of battle from his brow. “Were some to
retreat without orders, I imagine they would be
court-martialed and beheaded.”</p>

<p>But all battles must come to an end sooner or
later, and by sundown the great struggle for the
Yalu was over, and the victory was entirely in the
hands of the Japanese, while the Russians were well
on the way to Feng-wang-cheng. The battle had
thoroughly exhausted both sides, and the Japanese
were content to rest on their laurels, while the Russians
did what they could to reorganize their shattered
forces and construct a new line of defense.</p>

<p>The great battle of the Yalu was remarkable in
more ways than one. For the first time in history
a well-organized European army was defeated by
an army of the Asiatic race. The Japanese had
proved themselves not only masters of the art of war
on the sea but also on land, and the victory was so
complete that it left no room for doubt. In the
future Japan would have to be reckoned with as one
of the world powers.</p>

<span class="fs80">AMONG THE RUSSIAN SPIES</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The battle of the Yalu was followed by several
days of rest for Gilbert and his friends, for which
they were not sorry. In the fighting Ben had sustained
a severe wrench of his left ankle, and he was
content to take it easy in one of the houses of Kiu-lien-cheng,
around which the University Corps were
quartered.</p>

<p>Both Gilbert and Ben were anxious to learn how
Dan Casey had fared, and the former lost no time
in hunting up Carl Stummer and questioning
him.</p>

<p>“Da vos took poor Tan to der temborary hosbital,”
answered the German sharpshooter. “Der
doctor said he couldn’t fight yet a-vile.”</p>

<p>“But he’ll get over it?”</p>

<p>“Yah, he said Tan vould git ofer it—put he must
haf rest.”</p>

<p>“How did you make out Carl?”</p>

<p>“Oh I dink me I knock out more as six Roossians,
Gilpert. Ven Tan got shot I got mine tander<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
up, und I sailed in like neffer vos alretty. Say, put it
vos a great fight, hey?”</p>

<p>“You are right.”</p>

<p>“Vot you dinks ve vos going to do next?”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll follow them up,—as soon as we get
into shape to do it. Our baggage trains have got to
get across the river first—and we want re-enforcements,
too, I imagine,” concluded the young
captain.</p>

<p>It was not until a week after crossing the river
that the Japanese army moved forward to Feng-wang-cheng,
which the Russians abandoned without
showing fight. In the meantime fair-sized Japanese
forces landed at Pitsewo and Kin-chow, on the
Liao-tung Peninsula, just north of Port Arthur,
and cut off all telegraphic communications which the
city had heretofore enjoyed with the outside world.
This was a serious blow to the Russians at the port,
but other blows far more serious were soon to
follow.</p>

<p>The Russians at Dalny, the station just north of
Port Arthur, were now growing anxious, and before
long a large part of the seaport, which had cost
many millions to build up, was blown up by them,
and they prepared to evacuate the place.</p>

<p>The tide of war seemed to have set in strongly for
the Japanese, but now came a setback which they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
scarcely looked for. In another naval engagement
off Port Arthur the armored cruiser <em>Yoshino</em> was
rammed in the fog, and the battleship <em>Hatsuse</em> was
sunk by a mine. It is said that by the sinking of
these two ships the Japanese also lost upward of
four hundred officers and sailors. In addition to this
the Japanese lost several transports and merchant
ships, destroyed or captured by the Russian fleet
sailing from Vladivostok.</p>

<p>It could now be seen by the outside world what the
general campaign of the Japanese army was to be.
By landing forces above Port Arthur they virtually
cut that place off from the rest of the world, and
thus placed it in a state of siege. With the navy
hammering from the water side, the army advanced
closer and closer to hem in the place so that it would
have to surrender or be destroyed. In order to keep
back re-enforcements for the Russians, the army of
the Yalu now began to advance toward Liao-Yang,
on the railroad which connects Port Arthur with
Mukden and other Russian strongholds further
north.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that the Russians gave the
army under General Kuroki as much rest as many
would have wished. There were constant skirmishes
and small battles, and not a few were killed or
wounded on both sides.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span></p>

<p>Spies were sent out constantly by both commanders
to learn just what the enemy was doing.
So far many Japanese spies had lost their lives, or
been taken prisoners, yet the call for men for such
duty was always answered eagerly.</p>

<p>One hot day early in July Gilbert and Ben found
themselves on a trail leading over one of the hills
far to the westward of Feng-wang-cheng. It had
been reported that numerous Russian spies were in
that vicinity, doing their best to get in and out of
the Japanese lines. How the work was being carried
on nobody seemed to know, and a detachment was
sent out, under Major Okopa. The major had taken
with him the two young Americans and six of his
best sharpshooters.</p>

<p>“Well, the war seems to have come to an end in
this vicinity,” remarked Ben, as they moved along,
past a forest on one side and a tall cornfield on the
other. “What do you think of it, Gilbert?”</p>

<p>“I think the general is preparing for another such
ten-strike as we made when we crossed the Yalu.
What do you think, major?”</p>

<p>“I think so myself,” answered the Japanese major,
whose knowledge of English, thanks to Gilbert and
Ben, was improving daily. “You must remember,
we now have three armies in the field—one under
our own general, one under General Oku, and a third<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
under General Nodzu. I believe that before long
the greater portion of the three armies will unite, and
then we shall drive General Kuropatkin clear back
to Russia.”</p>

<p>“They tell me the Russian commander has an
immense force behind him.”</p>

<p>“That may be true. But we have also large
armies,—and you know how our men fight.”</p>

<p>“Yes, they could not have done better,” put in
Ben.</p>

<p>“There is another thing to consider,” went on the
Japanese major. “We have no troubles at home to
worry us, while Russia has troubles without number.
She must always keep some soldiers at home,
or there may break out a revolution which will
annihilate her.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know that,” said Gilbert. “Just the
same, I hardly think this war is going to end this
summer.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid not,” and the Japanese major
sighed. “That is Russia’s one hope—that she may
wear Japan out. She has so many more people, and
her resources are so much greater. But, should
Russia win in the end, it will be at a cost that will
stagger her and her financiers.”</p>

<p>A little later the talk came to an end, because it
was felt that a Russian detachment might be close<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
at hand. They had now passed into the cornfield
and were moving toward a slight rise of ground.
To the east and the west were heavy woods, and
behind them a fair-sized brook, where all had
stopped to get a drink, for the march had proved a
tiresome one.</p>

<p>So far the only persons they had met on the way
were Chinese farmers, all of whom bewailed the fact
that an army was in the vicinity, and who wanted to
know who was to pay for the crops stolen or destroyed.</p>

<p>They were just passing a farmhouse when, on
glancing back, Gilbert caught sight of two bearded
faces peeping at them from behind a haystack. The
faces disappeared as soon as the young captain
caught sight of them.</p>

<p>He did not report the matter at once, but called
a halt as soon as the haystack was out of range and
told Major Okopa of what he had seen.</p>

<p>“Let us go back instantly and investigate,” said
the Japanese officer.</p>

<p>“Hadn’t we better be careful?” suggested Gilbert.
“If they were Russians there may be more of them
in the vicinity.”</p>

<p>“Be prepared for anything that may happen.”</p>

<p>The major took the lead in retracing the way to
the farmhouse. As soon as the detachment came in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
sight, one of the Chinese farmers emitted a long,
low whistle.</p>

<p>It was evidently a signal, and several men were
seen to pass out of the back of the farmhouse in the
direction of a small barn close by. The men were
in Chinese dress, but that they were Russians there
could be no doubt.</p>

<p>“Halt!” cried Major Okopa, in Japanese, and repeated
the command in Russian.</p>

<p>For reply, a shot was heard, and a bullet struck
the brave officer in the shoulder. Then came other
shots, aimed at the rest of the detachment. But no
one else was hit, and they returned the fire as quickly
as they could. Whether or not any of the enemy
were reached they could not tell, for Russians and
Chinese had now disappeared.</p>

<p>As Major Okopa fell Gilbert ran into the
farmhouse, with Ben upon his heels. They saw a
man disappearing into an inner apartment, and
rushing forward Gilbert tripped him up. Then came
a shot through a window, and Ben fired at the Russian
who had aimed it, and the enemy fell in the
grass outside. In the meantime the rest of the detachment
went after some Russians and Chinese
in the barn, and a fierce hand-to-hand struggle
ensued.</p>

<p>With the major seriously, if not mortally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
wounded, the command of the detachment fell upon
Gilbert, and as quickly as he could he called his men
together, and placed them behind a corn-crib
which commanded a view both of the house and
the barn. One man had been killed, and, among
the Russians and Chinese, three were badly
wounded.</p>

<p>“I think there are about three Chinese and about
nine or ten Russians,” said Ben, after the first excitement
was over, and they had done what they
could for the major. “The Chinese do not amount
to much as fighters, but those Russians appear to
know their business.”</p>

<p>“I reckon we can show them that we know ours,”
replied Gilbert dryly.</p>

<p>“What you propose to do?”</p>

<p>“Shoot them down as soon as they show themselves.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps they won’t show themselves.”</p>

<p>“Yes they will. Just look there!”</p>

<p>As the young captain spoke he pointed to a spot
between the barn and the house. Here were piled
some dry cornstalks. In some unaccountable manner
the cornstalks had caught fire, and a stiff breeze
that was blowing was sending the sparks flying in
all directions.</p>

<p>“Good. I hope the sparks set fire to the barn,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
cried Ben, and hardly had he uttered the words when
the roof and one side of the structure, which was
very dry, burst into flames. The smoke rolled into
the barn, and those inside had to either come out or
be burned like rats in a trap.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV<br>
<span class="fs80">FIGHTING IN A STORM</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“Here they come!”</p>

<p>It was Ben who uttered the cry, a few minutes
after the smoke rolled into the barn, and he was
right. Four of the Russians had found the spot too
hot for comfort, and they rushed out with their guns
in hand.</p>

<p>A volley from those hidden behind the haystack
greeted the enemy, and two were killed outright and
another wounded. The fourth ran behind the house,
and a moment later he was followed by two Chinamen.</p>

<p>By this time the barn was in flames from top to
bottom, and it was not long before the house also
caught. Then came a fierce yelling from both the
Russians and the Chinese, and all that were able to
do so rushed through the smoke to the shelter of the
nearest cornfield.</p>

<p>“After them, men,” cried Gilbert, in Japanese,
and he led the way, followed closely by Ben. Before
the cornfield could be gained one of the Russians<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
was hit in the leg and laid low. The others,
with the Chinese, managed to make their escape.</p>

<p>“Well, that was a hot skirmish while it lasted,”
was Gilbert’s comment, on returning to the vicinity
of the house and the barn.</p>

<p>“Yes, and the worst of it is, that Major Okopa
has been seriously wounded.”</p>

<p>Leaving the buildings to burn down the Japanese
detachment counted up its loss. One man had
been killed and two, including the major, wounded
seriously. All were cared for as tenderly as possible,
and then it was decided to return to camp without
delay and report what had occurred.</p>

<p>“We didn’t catch many Russian spies this trip,”
was Ben’s comment, as they stalked along, the soldiers
carrying the wounded ones between them.</p>

<p>“It was a surprise, no doubt of it,” returned
Gilbert, but he did not dream of the still greater
surprise in store for them.</p>

<p>Less than a mile was covered when they heard a
noise to their left. At first they imagined it was a
band of Russians, and thought to seek shelter, but
then they came upon a small body of Japanese soldiers,
two companies in all, also bound for the camp.</p>

<p>“We’ve been on special outpost duty,” said the
officer in command, to Gilbert. “We have seen
nothing of the enemy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span></p>

<p>He was much surprised to learn of what had
occurred, and readily consented to go after those
who had caused the trouble. The two companies
were separated, one to return to the camp with those
who had been wounded, and the other to go on the
hunt for the fleeing enemy.</p>

<p>Gilbert and Ben went with the latter command,
taking two of their own soldiers with them.</p>

<p>“I don’t know if this is a good move or not,”
said Gilbert. “But I should like to round up the
fellows who knocked over poor Major Okopa.”</p>

<p>“That’s exactly the way I look at it,” answered
Ben. “And, for all we know, those rascals may be
the very spies we want. You can depend upon it,
they weren’t so close to our lines for nothing.”</p>

<p>The march was in the direction of the cornfield.
Here the trail was soon struck. It led to the northwest,
over a slight rise of ground and then along a
small brook, into which it disappeared.</p>

<p>“I hope we have not lost it,” was Gilbert’s comment,
as all came to a halt in perplexity.</p>

<p>But the trail was not so easily missed. Getting
down close to the water, several of the Japanese
soldiers made an examination which would have
done credit to an Indian. Soon they announced
that the trail led down the stream. It was followed
up despite the fact that it was from a foot to two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
feet under water, and a few rods away was found
to lead directly into a patch of short timber.</p>

<p>The men were now ordered to move forward with
caution, and each weapon was held in readiness for
immediate use. It was growing dark rapidly,
and there was every indication that the hot summer
day was going to end in a violent thunderstorm.</p>

<p>“If it comes I imagine it will be a corker,” was the
way Ben expressed himself. “Don’t you notice
how close it is getting?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ve noticed that for the last hour. See,
it is beginning to rain already.”</p>

<p>The young captain was right. At first the drops
came down scatteringly, then followed a steady
downpour which increased rapidly.</p>

<p>Suddenly in the midst of this rain, one of the
Japanese soldiers in advance gave the alarm. He
had sighted two Russians, who instantly opened fire.
At once the whole company of Japanese pressed
forward.</p>

<p>The Russians who had fled earlier in the day had
gotten to a spot where about a dozen others of their
command were on guard—a lonely outpost such
as were then scattered for many miles between Feng-wang-cheng
and Liao-Yang and the railroad. Thinking
the Japanese had come upon them in force, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
fought desperately, and the skirmish was brisk for
fully quarter of an hour.</p>

<p>In this fight neither Gilbert nor Ben suffered any
injury, although more than once they came to close
quarters. Ben was driven against a tree by two
Russian soldiers and almost bayoneted, but the Russians
were attacked from behind and driven off.
Gilbert was also attacked by a Russian officer, and
the sword play lasted for fully a minute, when
the Russian dropped back between some of his
men, convinced, no doubt, that he had met his
match.</p>

<p>In the meantime the storm increased in violence.
The air was almost black, when a vivid flash
of lightning blinded many of the fighters. Then
came a deluge of rain, through which little or nothing
could be seen. Taking advantage of this sudden
burst of the tempest, the Russians began to retreat,
and were soon lost to sight.</p>

<p>The Japanese were of a temper to follow, but in
such a deluge this was simply impossible. The rain
now came down in sheets, driven by a wind which
was constantly increasing in violence.</p>

<p>“This is a storm and no mistake,” cried Ben, as
he slung the water from his cap. “Puts me in mind
of some of the Philippine downpours.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and those we had in Cuba, when everything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
went sailing out of our camp,” added Gilbert.
“Gracious, but that lightning is sharp!”</p>

<p>He was right, the flashes were unusually brilliant
and dazzled them. The whole atmosphere appeared
to be charged with electricity, and the wind was now
blowing little short of a hurricane.</p>

<p>“We had better withdraw from this forest,” said
the officer in command of the company. “It is
dangerous to stay here in such lightning as this.”</p>

<p>Everybody was willing, and one of the number
suggested they move to where a slight rise of rocks
would afford at least partial shelter. In making this
move they had to cross the brook which has already
figured in our story, and then turn an angle formed
by a sharp rock backed up by several unusually large
trees.</p>

<p>Gilbert and Ben were just at this angle, with some
soldiers in front of them and some behind, when
there came a flash of lightning more brilliant than
any seen before. With this flash came an ear-splitting
crash from the heavens, followed by another
crash among the clump of trees.</p>

<p>Ben was dazed and so was Gilbert, and for the
moment both stood transfixed, not realizing what
had happened. Then Ben gave a glance at the trees
and saw that one was swaying unsteadily in the
wind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span></p>

<p>“It’s coming down!” he yelled. “It’s coming
down!” And he started to run to a place of safety,
followed by the Japanese soldiers and their officers.</p>

<p>Gilbert heard his chum’s cry, but did not realize
at first what it meant. The lightning flash had produced
a shock through his whole system, and he felt
as if a thousand needles were being thrust into him
at once.</p>

<p>“Run, Gilbert, run!” screamed Ben, when he
saw that his chum did not move. “Run, or the
tree’ll come down on you.”</p>

<p>“Wha—what?”</p>

<p>“Run, I say! Don’t you see the tree is coming
down?”</p>

<p>Gilbert now understood the words, and glanced
toward the clump of trees. The largest was already
over at an angle of forty-five degrees. In a moment
more it was sure to hit the earth and crush everything
beneath it.</p>

<p>Gilbert started to leap to a point of safety. But his
legs were weak from the shock received and he
stumbled on the rocks and fell headlong.</p>

<p>As he went down the tree gave another crash and
dropped ten or fifteen degrees more, so that some
of the branch ends touched the prostrate captain’s
body.</p>

<p>Ben saw the danger fully, and gave a scream of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
horror. Was it possible that he was going to see
his chum mangled before his very eyes? He shivered,
and an icy chill ran down his spine.</p>

<p>Then like a flash his mind was made up. He must
save Gilbert at any cost. He turned back and
crawled under the tree branches.</p>

<p>“Have a care!” shouted the Japanese captain.
“Have a care! The tree is settling! You will be
caught!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Ben!” gasped Gilbert. He could say no
more, for a thick limb was pressing him to the earth
and cutting off his wind.</p>

<p>“Give me your hand, Gilbert! There, that’s it!
Now try to pull yourself loose!”</p>

<p>“I—I can’t do it! I—my clothing is caught, and
I—I—”</p>

<p>“Here, turn around on your side—this way.
Now see if you can’t crawl out backwards.”</p>

<p>Another crack of the tree drowned out the last
of Ben’s suggestion. But Gilbert understood and
turned over. Then Ben pulled upon his chum’s arm
with all his strength.</p>

<p>“My—shirt—it’s caught in that branch!” gasped
Gilbert. “See—if—you can—haul—it—back!”
He could scarcely speak.</p>

<p>Ben had hold of the branch before Gilbert had finished.
He twisted it back by main strength. Then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
he held it with one hand, and pulled upon Gilbert
with the other.</p>

<p>At last the young captain was free. But the tree
was coming down now, and a great mass of branches
settled slowly over both of the young Americans,
hiding them completely from view in the rain and
darkness.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV<br>
<span class="fs80">ON THE MARCH</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The Japanese soldiers felt sure that both Gilbert
and Ben had been crushed by the final sinking of the
big tree, and they were much astonished to behold
Ben crawling forth a minute later, dragging his
chum with him.</p>

<p>“Are you hurt?” demanded the Japanese captain,
as he ran up, for the danger from the monarch of the
forest was now over.</p>

<p>“Only a few scratches,” was Ben’s answer.</p>

<p>“And your friend?”</p>

<p>“I—I—reckon I am all right,” gasped Gilbert,
struggling to his feet. “But I don’t want to get
quite so close to the lightning again.”</p>

<p>“No, nor I,” answered the captain, who had been
just in front of Ben.</p>

<p>After this the whole party lost no time in making
their way to the shelter of the rocks. At the best
the protection here was not very good, but it was
better than nothing, and nobody thought of complaining.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span></p>

<p>For fully an hour and a half the rain continued
to come down in torrents until everybody was soaked
to the skin. As it was warm, this was no great inconvenience
so long as they kept out of the fierce
wind which was blowing.</p>

<p>“It looks to me as if this storm was going to last
all night,” said Ben, and his surmise proved correct.
For a while the wind let up a little, but at midnight
it came as hard as ever, with another burst of lightning
that kept everybody from going to sleep. Making
a fire was out of the question, and the soldiers,
including the officers, had to eat their rations cold.</p>

<p>“There is no fun in being a soldier in such
weather as this,” observed Gilbert, as he and
Ben crouched under the shelter of a small overhanging
rock. “It knocks the glory sky high.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve got to take the fat with the lean,
as the saying goes, Gilbert. War was never meant
to be a parlor play.”</p>

<p>“I wish our command would advance. I’m tired
of lying around this vicinity.”</p>

<p>“So am I. But I reckon General Kuroki won’t
advance until he gets support from the other armies
in the field. He can’t face the whole of General
Kuropatkin’s force alone.”</p>

<p>Towards daybreak the storm began to subside,
and by sunrise only a few scattering drops came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
down, while the wind died out entirely. The soldiers
scurried around to get the driest wood they
could find, and lost no time in preparing a hot breakfast,
which was more than welcomed by all.</p>

<p>“You may say what you please, but a soldier can’t
fight very well on an empty stomach,” came from
Ben, while drinking his coffee.</p>

<p>“Sometimes soldiers fight better that way, Ben,”
said Gilbert, with a faint smile. “We’ve done it,
and more than once, too. But I didn’t like it.”</p>

<p>“What’s the next move, I wonder?”</p>

<p>“I fancy we had best get back into the lines where
we belong.”</p>

<p>“I agree with you.”</p>

<p>The Japanese officer consulted with them, and not
long after this they were traveling along a trail
which took them directly into camp.</p>

<p>As soon as word reached headquarters that a
number of Russians were in that vicinity, a strong
detachment was sent forth to round them up. This
brought on a fierce engagement, in which half a
dozen were killed or seriously wounded on either
side.</p>

<p>The young Americans were glad to take a rest
after their numerous adventures. The army moved
forward from day to day, but, strange to say, the
Russians kept their distance, falling back from one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
point to another. The fighting was now largely in
the neighborhood of Port Arthur and Dalny, and
consequently the command that had crossed the Yalu
so bravely had little to do.</p>

<p>Towards the middle of July the three Japanese
armies were located in something like a great semicircle
a hundred and fifty miles in length, with
General Kuroki on the right flank, General Oku on
the left, and General Nodzu occupying the center.
It was Oku who had done the most fighting around
Port Arthur. Now his army was divided, a portion
remaining behind to besiege the city, and the rest
traveling northward, along the line of the railroad.
General Nodzu had landed at Taku-Shan, some
miles below the mouth of the Yalu, and so far had
defeated the Russians at Siu-Yen, compelling them
to fall back in the direction of the railroad and An-Ping.</p>

<p>“This looks to me as if the Russians were going
to concentrate at either Hai-Cheng or at Liao-Yang,
on the railroad,” said Gilbert, when the news
was brought in.</p>

<p>“More than likely it will be Liao-Yang,” answered
Ben. “I’ve been told that the Russians have
been fortifying that town for a long while, and have
great quantities of supplies stored there.”</p>

<p>What Ben said about Liao-Yang was true. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
Russians were doing all in their power to make it
a great stronghold, and had stored there immense
amounts of supplies.</p>

<p>General Kuropatkin, the commander of the Russian
army, now had at his command an army of
about one hundred and thirty thousand men. The
main portion was in the vicinity of Liao-Yang, with
detachments as far south as Tashichiano, and as
far north as Mukden, all along the all-important
railroad.</p>

<p>Towards the end of July, Field Marshal Oyama,
Commander-in-chief of all Japanese armies, arrived
at Dalny, and at once took general charge of the
operation of the war from the Japanese side. A
general advance was ordered, both along the railroad
and from the east and southeast, the object
being not so much to drive General Kuropatkin back
as to hem him in, and either annihilate his force, or
compel his army to surrender.</p>

<p>The result of those movements brought our young
Americans once more to the front. At one of the
mountain passes they got into a fierce engagement
lasting several hours. The losses to both the Russians
and the Japanese were heavy, but luckily
both Gilbert and Ben came out of the contest without
serious injury.</p>

<p>Marching through the mountain passes in the hot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
weather was little pleasure, and when it rained the
roads were sometimes nothing but a mass of water
and mud.</p>

<p>“Bedad, but this is soakin’,” observed Dan Casey,
who was now out of the hospital once more.
A fine rain was falling and had been for several
hours.</p>

<p>“How are you feeling, Dan?” questioned Gilbert,
who was close by.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m almost meself again, captain. But I
had a close call. It was good of you to save me as
ye did. I’ll not be after forgettin’ it.”</p>

<p>“I was glad to be of service to you. I don’t want
to see any of my old friends go down and out in that
fashion.”</p>

<p>“It’s an honor to you to say it. Many an officer
would have passed me by,” answered the Irish
sharpshooter feelingly.</p>

<p>The sharpshooters were close to the command to
which Gilbert and Ben belonged. Just ahead was
some artillery, doing its best to get through the mud
which seemed to stick to the wheels like so much
paste.</p>

<p>“Orders to help the artillery out,” said Gilbert
presently, and one and another soldier took hold as
best he could, some pushing and some hauling on long
ropes. Gilbert and Ben were not above doing their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
share, the former helping at a wheel and the latter
shoving at the back of a cart. In the meantime
Casey and Carl Stummer got to work too, with a
log by which to pry the sunken wheels out of the
deepest of the mud.</p>

<p>It was hard, exhausting labor, with little of glory
in it, but nobody complained. The artillery had to
get to a certain Chinese village that night, and take
its position on some hills before daybreak.</p>

<p>“This is the seamy side of soldier life,” said Ben,
when there came a chance to talk.</p>

<p>“I dinks me it vos der muddy side, ain’t it?”
came from Stummer. “Py der poots! but I neffer
saf vorser mud py der Philippines!” And this
caused a short laugh.</p>

<p>The artillery was attacked by some Russians at
eight o’clock on the following day. A battery opened
on the Japanese, and then a body of Cossack cavalry
swept close to the village and up the hillside. But
the Japanese gunners were on the alert, and though
one gun was captured it was quickly retaken. Then
the Russians received a cutting cross-fire, which
made them retreat for several miles.</p>

</figure>
<br>

<p>The following day came another skirmish for the
infantry, on a side road where the briers were unusually
thick. This was difficult ground to fight
upon, and when the contest came to an end many of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>the soldiers found their trousers and leggings in
tatters and their shoes full of holes.</p>

<p>“We’ll certainly look like ragpickers if this keeps
on,” observed Ben that evening as he surveyed what
was left of his uniform. “That was a thorny hill
and no mistake.”</p>

<p>“Now you can play needlewoman,” cried Gilbert,
with a smile. “Come, get to work.”</p>

<p>“I’m too lazy and tired, Gilbert. It’s so hot.”</p>

<p>“Then hire one of the boys to do it for you.
Some of them are really expert at sewing.”</p>

<p>“A good idea,” was the reply, and soon Ben had
struck a bargain with a private to have all his
clothing mended, and also to have his shirt washed.
Then Gilbert closed a similar contract.</p>

<p>“Wish I could hear from Larry,” said Ben,
before turning in for the night. “I’d like to know
where he is, and how the old <em>Columbia</em> is making
out.”</p>

<p>“Let us trust that she has escaped the Russian
warships,” answered Gilbert.</p>

<p>“Yes, I hope that with all my heart. The Russians
wouldn’t hesitate a minute to sink her with all
her cargo, if they knew she was carrying Japanese
war material.”</p>

<span class="fs80">PRISONERS OF WAR</span></h2>
</div>

<p>It is not my intention in these pages to describe
all the numerous skirmishes and battles which took
place between the time General Kuroki’s army
crossed the Yalu and when the tremendous assault
was made upon the Russian army concentrated
around Liao-Yang.</p>

<p>At times the enemy contested the way bitterly,
while at others they fell back without making the
least show of resistance. As a matter of fact they
were too weak to engage in a regular battle, and their
one idea in harassing the Japanese was to delay the
forward movement of the Mikado’s men, and thus
give General Kuropatkin additional time in which
to strengthen his position at Liao-Yang.</p>

<p>“This war is getting to be nothing but a series of
skirmishes,” said Gilbert one day, as he and Ben
tramped along side by side.</p>

<p>“We’ll get it hot and heavy before long, mark my
words.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I believe that myself. I wonder how far
we are from the main body of the Russian army?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span></p>

<p>“I heard somebody say that Liao-Yang wasn’t
more than fifty miles away.”</p>

<p>“Then we are bound to strike something before
long.”</p>

<p>The next day a small body of the Japanese were
ordered to advance along a side road, to see if any
Russians were in that vicinity. With this body
went some of the soldiers under Gilbert and Ben,
and the Americans with them. The detachment was
under the command of a Japanese major who also
belonged to General Kuroki’s staff. He was a fine
fellow, and both Gilbert and Ben were soon on good
terms with him.</p>

<p>A few Russians were seen on the march, but these
fled before they could be captured or shot down.</p>

<p>“It is too bad we could not catch them,” said the
Japanese major to Gilbert. “They may cause us a
great deal of trouble.”</p>

<p>“You mean they may report to some other
Russians?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>A little later another body of Russians were discovered
up the side of a hill, in a big cornfield. At
once the detachment gave chase.</p>

<p>It was hot work, all the more so because the
ground in the cornfield was wet and slippery. In
this running fight, which lasted half an hour, two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
Russians were shot dead, and two Japanese privates
were slightly wounded. Then the Russians slipped
out of sight around a patch of timber and could not
be located again.</p>

<p>“They are slippery customers,” said Ben, after a
hunt through the woods. “Where do you think
they went to, Gilbert?”</p>

<p>“I give it up. Perhaps they ran hard and
reached that next patch of timber before we got to
this spot.”</p>

<p>“Could they go that far?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps they could—if they were scared.
When a man is badly frightened he can run like a
deer, you must remember.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is true—I’ve done a little running myself
at times.”</p>

<p>The Japanese major held a consultation with the
young Americans, and it was resolved that the best
thing to do would be to get back to the main body of
the army without delay.</p>

<p>“To follow those Russians might get us into
serious trouble,” said the Japanese officer. “There
may be more of their posts near by.”</p>

<p>The march was taken up a short while later and
led out of the woods and back to the high cornfield.
They were just entering into the cornfield when one
of the soldiers in front set up a cry of warning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span></p>

<p>“What is it, Gishuan?” questioned the Japanese
officer.</p>

<p>“Russians, a regiment of them!” was the startling
reply.</p>

<p>The report was correct, a whole regiment of
Russian infantry was moving swiftly and silently
across the cornfield. With them was a small detachment
of Siberian cavalry, the Cossacks looking
fierce and warlike.</p>

<p>“We cannot give battle to such a number!” murmured
the Japanese major. “Back, all of you, and
hide!”</p>

<p>Gilbert and Ben saw the wisdom of this move, and
turned to do as bidden, and so did the majority of
the Japanese soldiers. But one soldier, with more
enthusiasm than judgment, shouted a loud war cry
and discharged his gun.</p>

<p>Instantly there was a commotion among the
Russians, and some of the Cossacks came riding in
the direction whence the report had come.</p>

<p>“The Japanese!” was the cry. “The dirty sons
of Nippon! Charge upon them! Do not let them
escape!”</p>

<p>There was intense excitement, and orders were
quickly given to surround the Japanese if it could
be done. Heedless of the brushwood the Cossacks
dashed into the forest to get behind the enemy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
while the Russian infantry charged from the
front.</p>

<p>The Japanese and Gilbert and Ben met the shock
as bravely as possible. But with such an overwhelming
force against them the battle could terminate
in but one way. When nearly half of the
Japanese company had been shot down the balance
were called upon to surrender.</p>

<p>“You must give up!” roared a burly Russian
officer. “If you do not, you will be shot down like
so many dogs!”</p>

<p>Some of the Japanese soldiers replied to this
speech by a volley from their guns, and as a consequence
three more were killed. Seeing how hopeless
was the fight the Japanese major made a signal
of surrender, and Gilbert and Ben made similar
signals. Then the soldiers threw down their arms.</p>

<p>“Ha, ha! a glorious capture!” roared one of the
Cossacks, as the cavalrymen pressed closer on their
horses.</p>

<p>“Of what use to take prisoners?” came from a
half-drunken trooper. “Let us finish them where
they stand and move on.”</p>

<p>All of the Cossacks had been indulging freely in
<em>vodka</em>, a liquor much in use throughout Russia and
Siberia, and they were consequently reckless to the
last degree. Rushing in, three seized one of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
Japanese privates who was unarmed, and slashed
him around the neck with their sabers until he fell
lifeless.</p>

<p>It was a sickening sight and fairly made Gilbert’s
hair and Ben’s stand on end. Never had they seen
such a cold-blooded proceeding before.</p>

<p>“Do they intend to murder us?” faltered Ben.
“If so, we had better fight to the finish!”</p>

<p>Another Japanese soldier was attacked, but he
backed away and reached for his gun. It was
loaded and in a twinkling he raised it and shot one
of the Cossacks in the arm.</p>

<p>“Stop! In the name of the Holy Church I command
ye to stop!” came in the midst of the uproar,
and from behind the Russian infantry came the form
of a priest, with long black gown, and with a crucifix
in his hand.</p>

<p>At the sudden appearance of the priest the Cossacks
paused and shrunk back. The priest was an
elderly man, with white hair, but his eyes were clear
and firm and his voice steady.</p>

<p>“Such slaughter as this is not war,” he went on,
in a loud voice. “They have surrendered, then
make them prisoners.”</p>

<p>“Holy Father Rostosef, you are right,” came
from the commander of the Russian foot solders.
“We will make them prisoners, and they shall be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
treated as such.” He faced the Cossacks. “You
have disgraced your uniform. Retire to our left
flank.”</p>

<p>The Cossacks fell back still further, and presently
rode off, muttering among themselves. They did
not dare disobey their superior, and they were afraid
of the priest.</p>

<p>Some foot soldiers were then ordered up, and in
less than quarter of an hour all of the prisoners had
been searched and their weapons taken from them.
They were then told to form in a column of twos, and
were thus marched off, with the Russian infantry
formed all around them. The wounded were left
to take care of themselves, after having been given a
few rations and some water.</p>

<p>“Well, this is a turn of affairs I don’t like,”
whispered Gilbert to Ben, who was marching beside
him.</p>

<p>“Looks as if we were booked for some Russian
prison, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“That’s it, Ben,—or else some prisoners’ camp,
which may be just as bad.”</p>

<p>“Never mind, let us be thankful those drunken
Cossacks didn’t have their way and murder us all.”</p>

<p>“They are the toughest set of soldiers I have seen.
They must be next door to these Chinese brigands
they call Chunchuses.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span></p>

<p>“We’ve got that priest to thank for saving us.
They are afraid of him if they aren’t afraid of anybody
else.”</p>

<p>“Yes, the church has a strong hold on all Russian
subjects.”</p>

<p>At this point the Americans were ordered to keep
silent, and as there was nothing to do but to obey,
not another word was spoken for two hours.</p>

<p>At noon the regiment with its prisoners stopped at
a Chinese village for a brief rest. During this time
a Russian officer came to Gilbert and Ben and interviewed
them.</p>

<p>“You are Americans, I am sure,” said the officer.</p>

<p>“We are,” answered Gilbert promptly. He saw
no reason for evading the question.</p>

<p>“What prompted you to join the Japanese
army?”</p>

<p>“The love of fighting, as much as anything.”</p>

<p>At this the officer smiled grimly. “Have you
been to war before?”</p>

<p>“Yes—in Cuba, in Luzon, and I was in the army
that marched against Pekin, in 1900.”</p>

<p>“Ha, you surprise me! Then we have caught a
real pair of fighters, eh? What service did you see
during the march on Pekin?”</p>

<p>As well as his limited command of the Russian
language would permit, Gilbert told of his battles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
on Chinese soil, to which the officer listened with
keen interest. He was the hero of many a fight
himself and not very old either.</p>

<p>“I was in China—in some of the very fights you
mention,” he said, when the young American had
finished. “I remember the American command you
speak of. Our troops met it while on the march to
Tien-Tsin.”</p>

<p>“You did!” cried Gilbert. “Then perhaps we
fought almost side by side!”</p>

<p>“It is possible—and we had some Japanese fighting
with us too.” The Russian officer drew a long
breath. “Times have changed, have they not?”</p>

<p>“Yes—especially for us,” and Gilbert gave a short
laugh.</p>

<p>“I am sorry—in a way. If I could do anything
for you, I would. But I cannot,” returned the
Russian officer, and walked away.</p>

<span class="fs80">CAPTAIN BARUSKY HAS HIS SAY</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Contrary to their expectations the prisoners, and
especially the Americans, were treated well. The
Russians did not have the best of rations, but what
they did have they shared with all.</p>

<p>The march was kept up all of the afternoon, and
it must be admitted that by nightfall both Ben and
Gilbert were worn out. As usual, the Japanese did
not appear to mind it in the least.</p>

<p>“I believe those fellows could march on for three
days without stopping,” was Gilbert’s remark, as he
threw himself on the ground to rest. “They are
regular walking machines.”</p>

<p>A small Chinese village had been reached, and
here the prisoners were separated into four parties.
The two young Americans were placed by themselves
in a hut, in front of which two burly Russian
soldiers were stationed on guard.</p>

<p>“I wonder what they will do with us next?”
observed Ben, after a period of silence.</p>

<p>“Oh, I suppose we shall be taken to some Russian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
prison, Ben,—unless we can find some way in which
to escape.” Gilbert lowered his voice. “Do you
think it can be done?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. If we try it, we’ll run a first-rate
risk of being shot down.”</p>

<p>“Do you want to see the inside of a Russian
prison?”</p>

<p>“Not much! Some of them are little better than
dungeons, so I’ve heard.”</p>

<p>“Then we want to watch our chances.”</p>

<p>An hour went by, and they were given their evening
meal—some biscuits and some fruit which
happened to be at hand.</p>

<p>“I’d like to see that Russian officer again,” said
Gilbert. “I want to ask him if he knows Ivan
Snokoff.”</p>

<p>“Probably not—but it will do no harm to question
him,” returned Ben.</p>

<p>To Gilbert’s satisfaction the Russian officer came
in a little later. He had a package of Russian
cigarettes in his hand and asked them if they cared
to smoke.</p>

<p>“Thank you, but I am not addicted to the weed,”
said Gilbert, and Ben also declined the offer.</p>

<p>“I am glad you came in,” went on Gilbert. “I
wished to ask you if you know a party by the name
of Ivan Snokoff. He was at Port Arthur some time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
ago, running a business which he called the Russian-American
Importing and Exporting Company.”</p>

<p>“Ivan Snokoff?” The officer reflected a minute.
“I have heard the name Snokoff, but I do not recall
such a person as you mention.”</p>

<p>“He is a swindler, and swindled a company in
which I am interested out of four thousand dollars.”</p>

<p>“In that case he should be brought to justice.”</p>

<p>“Do you know a Captain Barusky? He was
stationed at Port Arthur at the time this war broke
out.”</p>

<p>Again the Russian officer mused for a moment.</p>

<p>“I think I do. To what command does he belong?”</p>

<p>“A regiment under Colonel Verga.”</p>

<p>“Yes, then I know him, although not very well.
Why do you ask about him?”</p>

<p>“He was mixed up in some of Ivan Snokoff’s
affairs. I think he advanced some money to Snokoff
and then they divided their ill-gotten gains.”</p>

<p>“That is a serious charge to make against an
officer.”</p>

<p>“But it is true.”</p>

<p>“Do you know that Captain Barusky’s regiment
has been transferred to An-Ping.”</p>

<p>“No, I did not know it.”</p>

<p>“We are bound for An-Ping.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span></p>

<p>“To the same place where Captain Barusky is
located?”</p>

<p>“Exactly. You will probably have a chance to
meet him face to face.”</p>

<p>This was astonishing news, and for the moment
Gilbert did not know what to say.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you are piling up trouble for yourself,
Gilbert,” said Ben, in English. “We may be
thrown into Captain Barusky’s power.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I understand,” answered Gilbert.</p>

<p>“If you wish to make a charge against Captain
Barusky, you will be likely to have an opportunity to
do so,” went on the Russian officer.</p>

<p>“I’ll think it over,” said Gilbert, and then the
subject was changed to the campaign in China. The
Russian officer was glad to talk about old times, and
remained with the young Americans the best part of
an hour.</p>

<p>“This is certainly news!” cried Gilbert, when he
had departed.</p>

<p>“Gilbert, the more I think of it, the more I
imagine you’ve put your foot in it.”</p>

<p>“I certainty have—if Captain Barusky has anything
to do with the prisoners.”</p>

<p>“You can be sure that he will single you out for
extra bad treatment—especially if he learns you
have been talking about him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span></p>

<p>“Well, I only told the truth.”</p>

<p>By morning it was raining once more, but despite
the storm the march toward An-Ping was resumed.
The route lay between the hills and mountains and
across several fair-sized streams. They passed
many Chinese villages, the inhabitants gazing at
both Russians and prisoners with ill-concealed interest.</p>

<p>Three days later the outskirts of An-Ping were
gained, and Gilbert and Ben were marched off to a
small stone building which was doing duty as a
temporal prison. Several apartments were filled
with Japanese, but they were put in a small room by
themselves. The room had a wooden bench, and in
one corner was a heap of foul-smelling straw to be
used for a bed.</p>

<p>“This is discouraging, to say the least,” remarked
Ben, as he gazed around him. “I wonder how long
they will keep us in this hole?”</p>

<p>Shortly after they arrived the Russian officer who
had proved so friendly came to bid them good-by.
It was the last they saw or heard of him.</p>

<p>On the following morning they got a taste of
regular prison fare. They were given a bowl of
mush which neither could touch.</p>

<p>“This is too strong for me,” declared Ben, after
smelling the contents of his bowl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span></p>

<p>Gilbert smiled grimly. “Just wait until you are
good and hungry and maybe you’ll be glad to tackle
it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see you eating very fast.”</p>

<p>“No, I’m waiting for you to lead the way.” And
then both laughed. After all there is no truer saying
than that “misery loves company.”</p>

<p>Four days dragged along slowly. Occasionally
they received something to eat which was fairly
good, and then they devoured it to the last scrap,
but the majority of the food was wretched in the
extreme. But they had a good supply of pure water
and for this, in such hot weather, they were thankful.</p>

<p>At the end of the fourth day came a surprise.
Without warning a Russian captain stalked into the
prison room and confronted Gilbert. It was Captain
Barusky.</p>

<p>“Ha! ha! So we have you at last, my fine
bird!” said he, gazing in a sinister manner at Gilbert.
“It was a good capture truly!”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Captain Barusky?”</p>

<p>“You know well enough what I mean.” The
Russian officer snapped his teeth together. “So
you have been talking about me, eh?” he added, in
a lower voice.</p>

<p>“I have said nothing that isn’t true.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span></p>

<p>“So you are going to make more trouble for me,
is that it?”</p>

<p>“I shall tell only the truth.”</p>

<p>“Bah! Who will believe you?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I’ll be able to present proofs.”</p>

<p>“Do you carry papers with you? I shall have
you searched.”</p>

<p>“I have no papers, so you need not trouble yourself.”</p>

<p>The Russian captain clenched his hands, and took
a turn around the apartment.</p>

<p>“I will not stand this!” he muttered. “You
wish to ruin my reputation. Do you know what I
am going to do? I shall denounce you to the
authorities as a well-paid spy.”</p>

<p>“I am no spy.”</p>

<p>“Who will take your word against mine? I
caught you spying at Port Arthur, and later,
when the authorities tried to catch you, you
fled.”</p>

<p>“My friend is no spy,” put in Ben. “He and I
are merely officers in the Japanese army.”</p>

<p>“You are both spies,” snarled Captain Barusky.
“I shall bring overwhelming proofs of it.”</p>

<p>“You have no such proofs,” said Gilbert, his eyes
flashing.</p>

<p>“You shall see.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span></p>

<p>“Perhaps you intend to manufacture the proofs,”
cried the young American.</p>

<p>For reply Captain Barusky shook his fist in Gilbert’s
face.</p>

<p>“Hold your tongue! I will show you what I can
do!” And with these words he rushed from the
prison room, slamming and bolting the heavy door
behind him.</p>

<p>For the moment after he was gone neither Gilbert
nor Ben spoke. Each looked questioningly at the
other.</p>

<p>“Do you think he’ll do as he says?” asked Gilbert,
at length.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t wonder. He is as mad as a hornet.”</p>

<p>“If they find us guilty as spies, they’ll shoot us on
the spot.”</p>

<p>“That is true. But can they find us guilty?”</p>

<p>“They can if Captain Barusky cooks up the
evidence. The Russian authorities will be only too
glad to get rid of two prisoners. Dead men don’t
need rations.”</p>

<p>“But they are bound to listen to our side of the
story.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps; but I don’t believe in trusting them to
do it.”</p>

<p>“Well, what do you advise?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Let us sit down and think it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
over. One thing is certain, we are in a tight
hole.”</p>

<p>Both sat down on the bench and gave themselves
up to thoughts which were far from pleasant. In
his mind each could see himself standing up in front
of a row of Russian soldiers, blindfolded, and shot
down. It made them shiver to think of it.</p>

<p>“I vote we make a break for liberty,” declared
Ben presently. “We might as well be shot down
that way as any other.”</p>

<p>“All right, I’m with you,—if it can be done,”
answered Gilbert.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII<br>
<span class="fs80">A RIDE FOR LIFE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>It was easy to talk of breaking for liberty but not
so easy to see how it could be done. The room in
which they were confined was of stone, solidly built,
and with one slit of a window, three feet high and
not over six inches wide.</p>

<p>“We can’t get through that window, that’s certain,”
said Ben, after measuring the opening.</p>

<p>“Not until we are pretty well starved,” grinned
Gilbert.</p>

<p>“And the door is about as solid and as well
bolted as one would wish.”</p>

<p>“That’s true, too. But I have a scheme, Ben—that
is if you are in the humor to try something
desperate.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m about in the humor to try anything.
That last meal was worse than anything yet given
to us.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and we’ll get worse still—if Captain
Barusky has anything to do with it.”</p>

<p>“What is your scheme?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span></p>

<p>“You know the guard is changed about the time
supper is brought in,” whispered Gilbert. “Sometimes
the guard doesn’t come up right away—I
mean the new man. The fellow who brings the
supper is rather old and feeble. Why can’t we overpower
him and lock him in?”</p>

<p>“And run our chances of getting out of the building
in the dark?”</p>

<p>“Exactly.”</p>

<p>“It’s mighty risky. There’s a whole company of
soldiers stationed in this vicinity.”</p>

<p>“If you don’t want to try it, say so.”</p>

<p>“Do you want to run the risk, Gilbert?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then I am with you. Shall we try it to-night?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Captain Barusky may have us hauled out
in the morning.”</p>

<p>From this point they began to lay their plans with
care. Gilbert was to keep in a corner, behind the
door, while Ben was to lure the soldier bringing
their supper into the center of the apartment. Then
Gilbert was to leap on the man from behind, and
close his mouth, while Ben shut the door, so that no
noise might reach the other parts of the building.</p>

<p>Nature favored them in their undertaking. In
the middle of the afternoon it began to darken down,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
and by supper time a heavy storm was in progress,
with considerable thunder and lightning.</p>

<p>“I am glad of this,” said Gilbert, as the rattle
of thunder ceased for a moment. “The more noise
there is, the better for us.”</p>

<p>Both were a trifle nervous as the time approached
for the soldier with supper to appear. They realized
that they were taking their lives in their hands.
A brace of bullets might end all for them.</p>

<p>Presently they heard the bolt shot back, and on the
instant Gilbert leaped behind the opening door. The
Russian soldier came in with two bowls of black
coffee and half a loaf of stale bread.</p>

<p>“Look here, somebody is up to something at the
window,” cried Ben pointing to the opening
through which the rain was driving.</p>

<p>“Who is there, the guard?” questioned the
Russian soldier and stalked in that direction.</p>

<p>This was Gilbert’s opportunity and like a flash he
leaped behind the man, clasped him around the chest
with one arm, and placed a hand over the fellow’s
mouth. As he did this, Ben leaped for the door
and shut it softly.</p>

<p>The Russian soldier struggled and did his best to
cry out. But he was no match for the two young
Americans, who did not handle him with as much
care as he might have received had the case been less<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
desperate. He received a stinging blow in the ear,
and another on the chin, and sank like a log to the
floor unconscious.</p>

<p>“Now or never!” cried Gilbert. “Wait till I
see if the coast is clear.”</p>

<p>He opened the door a few inches and peered forth.
Only one guard was in sight, and in a moment this
fellow had disappeared around an angle of the
passageway.</p>

<p>“Come on!” whispered Gilbert hoarsely.</p>

<p>“Wait—I want this pistol,” answered Ben, and
in a trice he had the weapon from the unconscious
soldier and also his box of cartridges. Then he ran
after his chum, who was already outside of the room,
and bolted the door in the usual fashion.</p>

<p>They had made up their mind which way to turn,
and now ran at their best speed to where a flight of
stone steps led to a small stone court. The door to
the court was open, so that some fresh air might
enter the prison hallway. Outside all was dark,
wet, and apparently deserted.</p>

<p>But they knew some guards must be at hand, and
they crawled along close to some empty boxes and
barrels with which the courtyard was littered.</p>

<p>“Bring a box along,” whispered Gilbert, picking
up one himself, and Ben understood and did as requested.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span></p>

<p>A few minutes more and a flash of lightning
showed them where the end of the courtyard was.
This also revealed to them a guard, standing in the
shelter of the wall, trying to keep out of the driving
rain. The guard’s back was toward them, so he did
not see the young Americans.</p>

<p>“Here’s as good a spot as any,” whispered Gilbert
presently, and placed his box close to the wall.
Ben put the second box on top and both climbed up.
Then over the wall they went, and darted down a
lane which another flash of lightning revealed.</p>

<p>So far no alarm had come from the prison, showing
that the attack on the man with supper had not
yet been discovered. It continued to rain furiously,
wetting them to the skin. But they only prayed that
the downpour might continue.</p>

<p>“Where are we getting to now, Gilbert?” questioned
Ben, after they had covered the best part of
a mile.</p>

<p>“We’re coming to the outskirts of the town, I
reckon. The houses if you’ll notice, are further
apart.”</p>

<p>“Keep your eyes open then, for the Russians may
have a picket guard out.”</p>

<p>“No doubt they have, and I am watching as hard
as I can.”</p>

<p>Presently another flash of lightning showed them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
a small barn, and two horses inside, saddled and
ready for use.</p>

<p>“Wait!” cried Ben, clutching his chum by the
arm. “Wait! I have an idea.”</p>

<p>He led the way into the barn. Nobody was
present, and he felt the animals, to find them
thoroughly dry.</p>

<p>“They have not been out and they must, therefore,
be fresh,” said he. “Shall we take them?
We can go a good many miles on them before daybreak.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we’ll take them, Ben. And see, there are
some military cloaks on yonder pegs. Let us take
two of them also.”</p>

<p>“And spurs, Gilbert! And a saber. We are
truly in luck—if we can get away undiscovered!”</p>

<p>In feverish haste each threw a military cloak
around his shoulders, put on a pair of spurs, and
Gilbert buckled on the saber. Then they untied the
horses, led them outside, and mounted.</p>

<p>“And now to ride for our very lives!” cried Gilbert,
and led the way down a road which the lightning
revealed to them. They put spurs to their
steeds, and in a short while An-Ping was left far
behind.</p>

<p>“We are not yet out of the woods,” said Ben.
“If the picket guard catches us, we are lost.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span></p>

<p>“I shall fight to the last, Ben!”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll fight, too,—if they give us a chance.”</p>

<p>No more was said. The rain was now letting up
a little, and the lightning was dying away to the
southward. They were riding toward the southeast,
for they imagined that in that direction lay the
Japanese camp, although how far off there was no
telling.</p>

<p>Half an hour later came an alarm. Out of the
darkness leaped a Russian guard, with a bayonet
fixed to his gun.</p>

<p>“Halt!” he shouted. “What is the countersign?”</p>

<p>“Moscow!” yelled Gilbert, on a venture. “Stand
aside, fellow! We carry important dispatches,”
and he crowded forward.</p>

<p>“But the countersign,” stammered the Russian
soldier. “They said it was Mukden.”</p>

<p>“Exactly—just what I said,” went on Gilbert
hurriedly. “Stand aside,” and he continued to
crowd forward. The next moment he and Ben were
past, on a gallop, the guard staring after them
blankly.</p>

<p>“Well, of all the bunco games!” murmured Ben,
when the alarm was over. “He’s a fine guard, isn’t
he?”</p>

<p>“A fine guard—for us, Ben. I hope he doesn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
wake up and fire a shot after us—or tell his
superiors.”</p>

<p>No shot came, and soon they felt that they were
well outside of the Russian lines. On a distant hillside
they saw a row of camp-fires burning and were
cautious to give them a wide berth.</p>

<p>All through the wet night they rode at the best
speed the horses could command. Both were good
steeds,—evidently belonging to officers of the
Siberian cavalry, by the trappings displayed. The
cloaks were also those of cavalry officers, so both
looked as if they belonged to the Russian army.</p>

<p>“Now we have got to look out that some Japanese
guard doesn’t shoot us down!” cried Ben, on the
way.</p>

<p>“We’re a long way from any Japanese camp, I’m
thinking,” was the answer.</p>

<p>At daybreak they came to an isolated Chinese
farmhouse. A careful investigation showed that
nobody was around but two farm-hands well advanced
in years.</p>

<p>“We want some breakfast, and at once,” said
Gilbert, to one of the hands. “Give us the best the
place affords.”</p>

<p>The farm-hand was scared, and speedily succeeded
in finding a young chicken and boiling it for them.
To this were added some rice cakes and some fruit,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
and also a pot of tea, and it is needless to say that the
young Americans ate heartily.</p>

<p>“Let us take turns at resting,” said Gilbert. “I
wouldn’t trust these Chinese.” And so it was arranged,
Ben sleeping two hours and then Gilbert
doing likewise. After that they ate a light dinner
and rode off once more. The horses had been fed,
and the rest put them in fairly good condition to
continue the journey.</p>

<span class="fs80">GILBERT PLAYS THE SPY</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The rain had cleared away and before long the
sun shone brightly. As it was warm, the two
young Americans discarded the cloaks they had
taken. Gilbert now held the pistol Ben had taken
from the soldier at the prison, while his chum carried
the saber found on the stable wall.</p>

<p>“We are not very heavily armed,” was Gilbert’s
comment. “But I reckon we could give a guard or
two a pretty stiff fight.”</p>

<p>“I move we steer clear of all Russians,—if we
can,” returned Ben.</p>

<p>“Oh, I agree on that. I’m talking about if we
are discovered.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it wouldn’t be a bad scheme to
hide in the woods somewhere and rest until it
gets dark again. We are surely on dangerous
territory.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good idea—unless we can make certain
there are no Russians around.”</p>

<p>Three miles were covered, and they were on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
point of making a sharp turn across a small stream
when Gilbert called a sudden halt.</p>

<p>“Into the bushes with you, Ben!” he cried, and
turned into a thicket backed up by some trees. His
chum followed, and they lost no time in reaching a
spot where they were well screened.</p>

<p>They had scarcely done this when they heard a
tramping on the road and a battery belonging to the
Russians hove into view. Each gun and each
ammunition cart was drawn by four horses, the
drivers whipping the animals unmercifully to make
them keep on the move.</p>

<p>“A stream, and no bridge!” the young Americans
heard somebody roar in deep anger. “How in
the name of the Czar are we to get across here?”</p>

<p>“Are there no rocks?” asked another voice.</p>

<p>“No, ’tis mud and it will be hub-deep if we try
to get over.”</p>

<p>“Then that staff officer told us to take the wrong
road. Maledictions upon his empty head! What
is to be done? We must reach Nan-shen-go Hill by
to-night. Those dirty sons of Nippon are hot after
us!”</p>

<p>There was confusing murmur of voices, which
ceased as a much louder voice was heard.</p>

<p>“Why are you standing here, wasting your time
and breath? Out with your axes and cut down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
some of yonder trees and throw them in the stream.
Must we waste all day here?” And a volley of
curses followed, in the midst of which several
artillerymen got out the axes referred to, and started
for the nearest of the trees.</p>

<p>It was the very thicket in which Gilbert and Ben
were in hiding, and for the moment both thought
they would be discovered. Then Gilbert slipped to
the ground.</p>

<p>“Come, lead your horse farther back,” he whispered
to Ben. “Make as little noise as possible.”</p>

<p>His advice was followed, and soon they found
themselves at a spot where further retreat, owing
to the softness of the soil, was impossible.</p>

<p>“Do you think they’ll come as far as this?”
questioned Ben.</p>

<p>“Hardly—it would be too far to drag the logs.
They’ll cut down only what is handy. But, Ben?”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“I am going to crawl forward and listen to what
they have to say. Perhaps I’ll hear of something
to our advantage.”</p>

<p>“Shall I go along?”</p>

<p>“No, you look after the horses.”</p>

<p>So it was arranged, and with the caution of an
Indian on the war trail, Gilbert crept forward
through the underbrush to a point where he could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
see and hear the greater part of what was going on.
Several small trees had already been cut down and
the artillerymen were casting branches and trunks
into the stream, so that they might bring their guns
and carts over in safety.</p>

<p>“Not much of a bridge, but safer for us than will
be the bridge at Shan-gow for the Japanese,”
chuckled one of the Russians while working.</p>

<p>“What about the bridge at Shan-gow?” asked
another, who had just come up.</p>

<p>“Oh, it was mended to suit our engineers, that is
all,” answered the first speaker, and chuckled louder
than ever.</p>

<p>“Did they set a trap for the dirty sons of Nippon?”</p>

<p>“That they did,” put in a third speaker. “A
fine trap, too.”</p>

<p>“Tell me what it was, Groski.”</p>

<p>“So you may tell the enemy, eh?”</p>

<p>“Do you take me for a traitor?”</p>

<p>“No, I was but fooling. They placed some
dynamite under the bridge and connected it in some
way with the planking. As soon as a heavy weight
like a gun or a body of soldiers gets on the bridge
something will go off, and the gun or the soldiers
will go up, sky-high!” And the speaker laughed
loudly, his companions joining in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span></p>

<p>“Dynamite does not blow up, it blows down,”
said one, after the laughter had come to an end.</p>

<p>“True for you, Shelapovsky; but there was powder
there as well as dynamite. You can trust our
engineers to fix a trap properly.”</p>

<p>“They left a big hole on the An-Ping road,” put
in another of the artillerymen. “It was on this side
of the river. It was covered with loose hay and had
pointed sticks at the bottom. I trust the enemy’s
artillery or soldiers get into that. They’ll have a
fine tumble!” And then the Russians laughed
again.</p>

<p>“Stop your talking and laughing!” shouted a
voice of authority. “Must we stay here all day?
Lazybones, get to work, or I’ll have you knouted!”
And then the task of building a temporary bridge
was hurried along in silence. Soon the artillery was
again on the move and had passed out of sight and
hearing.</p>

<p>Losing no time, Gilbert hurried back to where he
had left Ben and the horses.</p>

<p>“Come on, the coast is clear, and we have no time
to lose,” said he.</p>

<p>“Did you hear anything of importance?”</p>

<p>“I certainly did, Ben,” and the young captain
related the particulars.</p>

<p>“We must report this—if we’ve got time to do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
it,” exclaimed Ben. “Where is this Shan-gow
bridge?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t any idea, excepting that it must be
between us and General Kuroki’s army.”</p>

<p>“I’ve heard of such things before. Don’t you
remember the holes the Tagals in Luzon used to
dig?”</p>

<p>“To be sure I do. But they never blew up a
bridge with our artillery or soldiers on it.”</p>

<p>“If they did, I don’t remember it. Yes, you are
right, we must get back to camp at once and report
this.”</p>

<p>“If it isn’t too late,” was the grim response.</p>

<p>Once again they moved along the road leaving
the woods behind, and coming out to where there
were long patches of high corn—destined soon to be
trampled under foot by the march of countless
Japanese soldiers. In some spots the corn was so
high that it was impossible to see over it, even when
on horseback.</p>

<p>They passed several farmhouses, but the buildings
appeared to be deserted. Once a Chinaman peered
at them from behind a corn-crib, but as soon as he
was discovered the Celestial lost no time in disappearing.</p>

<p>“They seem to be scared to death,” was Ben’s
comment. “I suppose they think they are caught<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
between two fires, with the Japanese on one side and
the Russians on the other.”</p>

<p>“And they are, Ben. By this war some of them
will lose all they possess, and it is a question as to
who will pay them back after the conflict ceases.”</p>

<p>At the end of another mile the cornfields were left
behind, and they struck into a wooded road leading
more to the southward. A short distance beyond
was a cross-road, and here they paused for a minute
to “get their bearings,” as Gilbert expressed it.</p>

<p>“My gracious, look there!” cried Ben suddenly,
and pointed down the cross-road. A dozen men on
horseback had appeared, riding toward them at a
rapid gait. “Are those Japanese cavalry?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think they are,” answered Gilbert, after
a brief glance at the riders, who were all heavily
armed. “They look to me more like Chinese.”</p>

<p>“Chinese? And armed like that? Gilbert, if
that is true, they must be Chunchuses!”</p>

<p>“If they are, we had better get out and be quick
about it,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Right you are.”</p>

<p>Away they went along the main road. But
though they started off thus rapidly they were too
late to escape observation, and a second later a fierce
cry rent the air, and they were called upon, in
Chinese, to halt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span></p>

<p>“They are Chunchuses!” muttered Gilbert.
“Now, Ben, we must ride if we never rode before!
If those barbarians catch us, I don’t know what they
won’t do to us!”</p>

<p>“Torture us to death, more than likely!”</p>

<p>This was no idle speech upon Ben’s part. He had
heard all about the Chunchuses, who are nothing
more or less than Chinese bandits or brigands.
Large bodies of Chunchuses roam through Manchuria
and other parts of China, holding up people
wherever they can, and stealing all they can get
within their grasp. Some of the more savage of
them delight in torturing their victims, in the hope
of learning where money or other valuables have
been hidden. The war had made some of them
particularly bold, and on more than one occasion
Russian detachments had been sent out to shoot
them down without mercy wherever found.</p>

<p>The road ahead of the two young Americans had
several turns, so they hoped to be able to throw the
Chunchuses off the track should a side path appear
while their pursuers were out of sight. They
spurred their horses on at top speed, and the animals
responded as best they could, considering the limited
rest they had had after their night’s travel.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid we are not gaining much,” said Gilbert,
as they heard the shouts of the Chinese bandits<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
behind them. “Their horses must be fresh;” which
was a fact.</p>

<p>Soon came a more open patch of the road, and
here the young Americans tried to increase their
speed. But this was impossible, and gradually the
Chunchuses drew closer.</p>

<p>“Stop, or we’ll fire on you!” sang out the leader
of the bandits, and then a bullet whizzed between
Gilbert and Ben.</p>

<p>“This is getting hot,” muttered Gilbert. “If
they—hullo!”</p>

<p>He broke off short, and with good reason.
Directly ahead was another turn of the road. Here
more Chunchuses had put in an appearance. The
young Americans were hemmed in, and escape was
entirely cut off.</p>

</div>

<p>“What shall we do now, Gilbert?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know that we can do anything,” responded
the young captain dismally. “We are
caught, that is all there is to it.”</p>

<p>“Shall we show fight?”</p>

<p>“What is the use—they are fifteen or eighteen to
two.”</p>

<p>“And as villainous a looking crowd as I ever beheld.
We are in a pickle truly.”</p>

<p>“We may as well put on a bold front. When
they find we haven’t anything of value with us, they
may let us go.”</p>

<p>It was a forlorn hope, are they had no time to
give it further consideration. They brought their
horses down to a walk and the tired steeds were
glad of the change in gait. The bandits ahead had
halted to learn the condition of affairs. Now they
saw those behind Gilbert and Ben are set up a shout.</p>

<p>“They all belong to one gang, that is sure,” observed
Ben.</p>

<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span></p>

<p>“Let us keep on,” was the answer.</p>

<p>There was a clatter of hoofs, and amid shouts and
yells the Chunchuses surrounded the Americans and
compelled them to halt.</p>

<p>“Throw down your weapons,” said one, who was
the leader, and as there was no help for it, they did
as bidden. Then the leader asked them who they
were and where they had come from.</p>

<p>“We are Americans and attached to the Japanese
army,” answered Gilbert stiffly. “What do you
want of us?”</p>

<p>“All you possess,” was the ready return.</p>

<p>“You can have that and welcome, since we have
nothing with us.”</p>

<p>At this the brigands scowled and muttered among
themselves.</p>

<p>“Search them,” was the reply. “Do it well too.
These Americans are sly cats for hiding things.”</p>

<p>Both Gilbert and Ben were made to dismount and
were searched with great thoroughness. But as all
of their possessions had been taken from them by the
Russians at the prison, nothing of value was brought
to light. At this the Chunchuses grumbled loudly,
and pushed the young officers roughly.</p>

<p>“Perhaps they threw their goods into the thickets
as they rode along,” suggested one of the bandits.
“If so, make them confess where.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span></p>

<p>“Yes! yes!” came in a roar. “Make them confess!
They must have carried something of value.”</p>

<p>“You must tell us where you have put your valuables,”
said one of the bandits, and caught Gilbert by
the throat, while another held Ben.</p>

<p>“I had nothing but what you saw,” gasped Gilbert.
“Le—let me go.”</p>

<p>“We will not believe that. Confess!” And now
several of the Chunchuses drew their swords and
made movements as if to run the prisoners through.</p>

<p>“I have nothing, I tell you,” came from Ben.
“What are you going to do—murder us in cold
blood?”</p>

<p>“And why not? We care nothing for Americans,”
returned one of the bandits with a sneer.</p>

<p>“We have not forgotten the attack on Pekin,”
added another.</p>

<p>“But I——” began Gilbert, when a yell came
from one of the Chunchuses in the rear of the crowd.</p>

<p>“What is it, Hing Chang?”</p>

<p>“The Japanese sharpshooters! The same we met
last night!”</p>

<p>The report was correct—some Japanese soldiers
were rushing along the road with guns ready to
fire. In a second more a volley of shots rang out,
and three of the Chinese bandits fell to the earth,
two dead and the third badly wounded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span></p>

<p>“<em>Banzai!</em>” was the Japanese cry. “Here they
are—the rascals who stole the things from our
camp. At them, men! Let not one of them escape!”</p>

<p>“The sharpshooter! We must ride!” muttered
the Chunchuses. “They are too many for us!”
And letting Gilbert and Ben go, they leaped for their
horses with all speed.</p>

<p>The Japanese detachment continued to fire on
them, and they sent back two volleys in return. Then
they went clattering up the road as fast as their
horses could carry them.</p>

<p>The turn of affairs was bewildering, and the
Americans scarcely knew what to do. Then Gilbert,
who happened to possess a white handkerchief, which
neither Russians nor Chunchuses had cared to take
from him, hoisted it in the air as a flag of truce.</p>

<p>“<em>Banzai!</em>” he roared, and Ben joined in the cry,
to show the Japanese that they belonged to the army
and not to the bandits.</p>

<p>It was well they raised the handkerchief, for it
probably saved them from death. Even as it was,
several sharpshooters fired on them, but luckily the
shots did no further harm than to clip their clothing.</p>

<p>“Vell, of dis ton’t peat der pand!” shouted a German
voice. “Cabtain Russell und Cabtain Bennington,
or I vos dreamin’!” and the next instant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
Carl Stummer came forward from among the sharpshooters.</p>

<p>“Stummer!” gasped Ben, and was never so glad
to see a friend as at that moment. “And Casey,
too!”</p>

<p>“Say, but you’re after havin’ a close shave wid a
mighty sharp razor,” came from Dan Casey. “Was
it thim bandits as collared ye lasht week? Sure an’
I thought it was the Roossians.”</p>

<p>“We were captured by the Russians, Dan,” answered
Gilbert. “But we escaped, only to fall in
with those Chunchuses. I’m mightily glad you came
up.”</p>

<p>By this time the brief fight with the bandits had
come to an end, with another killed and two more
wounded. It is perhaps unnecessary to add that the
wounded Chunchuses were at once beheaded by the
Japanese—a common way of treating all bandits in
the Orient.</p>

<p>As soon as the excitement was over, a Japanese
officer in charge of the detachment listened to the
story Gilbert and Ben had to tell. That section
of the country was strange to him, and he did not
know where the Shan-gow bridge was located.</p>

<p>“About that hole in the An-Ping road there is
no use of worrying,” said he. “We have already
located a number of such holes, and our advance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
guard are watching for them. But I think you had
best report this bridge affair at headquarters without
delay. You have horses, so can make faster
time than we can.”</p>

<p>“Are there any Russians between here and the
camp?” asked Ben.</p>

<p>“I believe not. They are retreating to An-Ping
and Liao-Yang as fast as they can travel. General
Kuroki and General Nodzu are pressing them hard.”</p>

<p>After some talk Gilbert persuaded the Japanese
officer to allow Stummer and Casey to return to
camp with them—the sharpshooters to show them
the proper road to take, there being several a short
distance back.</p>

<p>“Sure, an’ this is a touch of old times,” said Dan
Casey, as the four moved off. “I’m after wishing
we were all in one company.”</p>

<p>“Oxactly mine vish, too,” said Carl Stummer.
“Put ve ton’t got eferyding in dis vorld vot ve
like,” and he heaved a ponderous sigh.</p>

<p>As they moved along they passed several spots
where the Russian outposts had had their camps,
and one place where a battery had been located—probably
the battery Albert and Ben had met on the
road. But nobody was around—Russian, Chinese,
or Japanese.</p>

<p>“It will take years for this country to recover<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
from the war,” remarked Ben. “It seems a shame
that such things have to be.”</p>

<p>“Sure an’ man’s a wild animal whin ye sthrip
th’ skin of civilization from him,” came from Casey.</p>

<p>The Irish sharpshooter expected to reach camp by
seven or eight o’clock in the evening, but when he
came to a spot where two roads presented themselves,
he paused, and scratched his head.</p>

<p>“Carl, which is the right road, do ye think?” he
asked, presently.</p>

<p>“Yah, dot is a riddle alretty! Maybe dot von on
der left,” answered the German.</p>

<p>“An’ I was after thinkin’ it was the wan on the
right.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t you sure, Dan?” questioned Gilbert.</p>

<p>“I confess I am not. I wasn’t watchin’ the road
very closely whin we came over the bit av a hill
yonder.”</p>

<p>After a brief consultation they decided to try the
road on the right for a mile or more. “If it runs to
the southeast, that is all we want,” said Gilbert.</p>

<p>It was a broad highway and unusually well kept.
As they advanced Dan Casey shook his head.</p>

<p>“Sure an’ I don’t think we had such good walkin’
as this, did we, Carl?”</p>

<p>“Not much ve didn’t,” declared the German
sharpshooter. “Der mud vos awful in sphots.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span></p>

<p>“Perhaps we had better go back,” suggested Gilbert.</p>

<p>“Let us keep to the road a while longer,” said Ben.
“It seems to run in the direction we want to go.”</p>

<p>There was a turn ahead, leading into a small valley.
At the turn they came to where they could see
a fair-sized stream of water ahead.</p>

<p>“Here is a hut,” said Ben, and pointed it out. In
front of the shelter sat an old Chinese woman, blinking
uncertainly at them.</p>

<p>“Sure an’ that ould woman ought to be able to
tell us about the road,” said Casey.</p>

<p>“I’ll question her,” replied Gilbert.</p>

<p>But to get any information out of the old woman
was not so easy. She was very deaf, and much
scared, and held up her hands as if supplicating them
not to kill her.</p>

<p>“We will not harm you,” shouted Gilbert into
her ear.</p>

<p>“I am poor!” she replied. “Poor! poor! poor!”</p>

<p>“Tell me what road this is,” he fairly bawled.</p>

<p>“I am poor and old! Do not slay me, kind
sirs!”</p>

<p>“What road is this?” he shouted. “What road?”
And he pointed up and down the highway.</p>

<p>“The road? It is the road to An-Ping and Liao-Yang.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span></p>

<p>“And where does it lead to in the other direction?”</p>

<p>“To the village of Shan-gow, just across the
bridge.”</p>

<p>“Shan-gow!” cried the young captain. “Is that
the Shan-gow bridge?”</p>

<p>“It is! Oh, spare my life!”</p>

<p>“Were the Russians at that bridge a day or two
ago?”</p>

<p>“Yes! yes! But what they did I do not know.
They said, if I went down there, I would be killed.”</p>

<p>Gilbert turned to his companions.</p>

<p>“That is the Shan-gow bridge—the one the Russians
mined,” he said, in English. “We have
reached it in time, after all.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but none too soon!” came from Ben.</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Ben?”</p>

<p>“Look along yonder road. A battery of Japanese
guns is coming at full speed, and they are bound for
the bridge!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXI">CHAPTER XXXI<br>
<span class="fs80">THE GREAT BATTLE OF LIAO-YANG</span></h2>
</div>

<p>What Ben said was true. A battery of six guns
was moving swiftly along the road which led to the
bridge of the stream before them. The battery was
so close that they could plainly hear the shouts of
the drivers, as they urged their horses along the
highway in the direction of the fatal spot.</p>

<p>“Come, there is no time to lose here!” shouted
Gilbert, and put spurs to his horse. Ben followed,
and away they went side by side to the very end of
the bridge.</p>

<p>Would it be safe to cross this structure? Each
asked himself that question, and then turned an
anxious look upon his companion.</p>

<p>“Better not try it,” said Ben.</p>

<p>“Let us ford the river—if we can,” returned
Gilbert, and turned his horse from the bridge to a
trail that led to the water’s edge.</p>

<p>Usually the stream was of small importance, but
the recent rains had greatly swollen the rush of
water. In they dashed and went down, first to their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
steeds’ knees and then to their bodies. The horses
were used to this sort of thing, however, and did not
hesitate or lose their footing.</p>

<p>The battery was thundering along not over
two hundred feet from the end of the bridge,
when Gilbert and Ben confronted the foremost
driver.</p>

<p>“Back! back!” shouted both, in their loudest
tones, and Gilbert added, as the driver still kept on:
“Back! for your life!”</p>

<p>He swung around, and reaching down, caught one
of the leading battery horses by the head. He continued
to shout, and just before the bridge was
reached the leading gun was halted, and the others
also came to a standstill.</p>

<p>“What does this mean?” demanded the captain
of artillery, as he dashed up on horseback.</p>

<p>“Don’t go on the bridge,” answered Gilbert,
saluting, while Ben did the same.</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“I have every reason to believe that the Russians
have placed a mine under it.”</p>

<p>At these words there was much astonishment, and
Gilbert and Ben had to tell all they knew. Mined
bridges are not new, and before long an examination
of the structure was made and some dynamite
and powder located, along with an electric battery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
and wire, set to explode the mine the moment an
extra heavy weight should pass onto the bridge.</p>

<p>“Captain, you have done us a great service,”
said the commander of the artillery to Gilbert. “I
shall not forget this and shall report it to the general.”
But the report was never sent in, for the
reason that two days later the captain of artillery
was killed, along with nearly half of the men composing
his battery.</p>

<p>From the captain Gilbert and Ben learned where to
find the command to which they belonged. In the
meantime, Casey and Stummer joined the others—walking
over the bridge when it was safe to do so—and
the four went forward as before.</p>

<p>“Dot vos a great ding to do—safe dot pattery,”
remarked Stummer. “Dot vos a fedder mit your
cab in, cabtain.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I did no more than my duty,” said Gilbert
modestly. And then he insisted upon changing the
subject.</p>

<p>When the camp was gained late that evening
many were astonished to hear what both Gilbert and
Ben had to tell. They reported in full, and told of
the movements of the enemy so far as they knew
them.</p>

<p>“It was a daring thing to escape from that
prison,” said one of their superior officers. “Had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
they caught sight of you, they would surely have
shot you down.”</p>

<p>“We knew the risk we were running,” answered
Ben. “We don’t want another such experience.”</p>

<p>In the camp they found a number of letters awaiting
them. Ben had two from home—one from his
brother Walter, and one from his Uncle Job Dowling.
Both said that matters were running smoothly,
and that Walter was doing remarkably well in his
new business. They were surprised that Ben had
gone into the army with Gilbert, but wished him
well. They added that so fair they had not heard
from Larry since he had left Nagasaki on the
<em>Columbia</em>.</p>

<p>Gilbert’s principal letter was from the Richmond
Importing Company. In this he was complimented
on having made such a good bargain with the Japanese
authorities for the <em>Columbia’s</em> cargo, and for
having sent the schooner to Manila for another
cargo. He was also advised to keep his eyes open
for Ivan Snokoff, and bring that rascal to justice if
it could possibly be done.</p>

<p>“As if I hadn’t done my best to run him
down,” said Gilbert, after reading the letter to his
chum.</p>

<p>“I suppose they do not realize the difficulties in
the way,” answered Ben. “But, somehow, I feel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
it in my bones that you’ll run across Snokoff some
day, and before this war is over, too.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t seem possible, Ben. He’ll be sure to
keep away from any Japanese advance.”</p>

<p>Both Gilbert and Ben were glad to rest for several
days after returning to camp. The men of their
companies were delighted to have them back, and
each insisted upon coming up and shaking hands.</p>

<p>During those days of idleness Gilbert was surprised
one day to receive a visit from Jiru Siko.</p>

<p>“Come to war las’ week,” explained the little
brown man. “All wife an’ children in Nagasaki
now. Going to fight Russians all time, show ’em
what Jiru Siko can do—not afraid of them, no!”</p>

<p>“Good for you, Siko!” laughed Gilbert. “I
hope you come out of the campaign a general.”
Then he asked about the <em>O-Taka</em> and her captain,
and learned that the vessel was now being used to
transport soldiers and stores along the Korean coast.</p>

<p>The advance of General Kuroki’s army in the
direction of Liao-Yang began August 23. There
was a smart skirmish with a small body of Russians
who immediately fell back towards An-Ping. After
this Field Marshal Oyama ordered a general advance
of the three Japanese armies, and it was this advance
which brought on the great chain of fights lasting
ten days, which are now known as the battle of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>
Liao-Yang—a bloody struggle which has few
parallels in history. In this contest over four hundred
thousand men were engaged, the battlefield
extending over a distance of seventy-five miles, and
the killed and wounded numbered fully thirty thousand.</p>

<p>As said before, the Japanese commander not only
washed to confront General Kuropatkin in battle,
but he wished also to get behind the Russian general
and cut him off from a possible retreat northward
along the line of the railroad. For this reason, while
General Oku and General Nodzu hammered at the
Russian front, General Kuroki struck the Russian
line in the far east, and did his best to turn the
enemy’s flank.</p>

<p>Liao-Yang is on the Tai-tse River, which flows
almost east and west. In order to get around the
Russian flank it was necessary for General Kuroki
to cross the river, as well as cross several smaller
streams. All of the hills in that vicinity were in
the possession of the Russians and were protected
by batteries. There was a strong Russian
detachment at An-Ping, and another at Liandiansian.</p>

<p>General Kuroki’s army advanced in three columns,
through the valley of the Lan, a small stream
flowing into the Tai-tse, and here it was that a hot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>
fight was experienced, in which both Japanese and
Russians showed uncommon bravery. The Japanese
general wished to separate the two Russian fighting
forces, but his plan was only partly successful, and
before the third day’s fighting in that vicinity, General
Kuropatkin became alarmed at the possibility
of having his flank turned, and ordered his troops to
fall back, which they did, leaving An-Ping and
numerous other places of advantage in the hands of
the Japanese.</p>

<p>The first shock of this great battle was felt by Gilbert
and Ben the second day after the general advance
was begun. The battalion was ordered to
help drive a Russian battery from its position on
a small hill, and away went the Japanese soldiers
on the double-quick, with fixed bayonets.
“<em>Banzai! banzai!</em>” was the cry, and the charge was
delivered with tremendous fierceness. The Russians
answered by pouring in a deadly fire which killed
fully a quarter of the companies. But the Japanese
did not waver, and went forward once more with
louder shouts than ever.</p>

<p>“This is war, if ever there was such a thing!”
panted Ben, as he came up beside Gilbert, after the
fighting had continued the best part of half an hour.
He was dripping from perspiration and so out of
breath he could scarcely speak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span></p>

<p>“Both sides seem to know how to fight,” was Gilbert’s
reply.</p>

<p>“What is the matter with your left hand?”</p>

<p>“I got stuck with a bayonet. But it doesn’t
amount to much.”</p>

<p>“Do you think the Russians will retreat?”</p>

<p>“We are ordered to charge until they do, Ben.
There is no retreat for our side,” answered the acting
major of the battalion.</p>

<p>Again came the shock of battle, and once more a
great number of men were mowed down. But now
the Russians broke and started to run. Then the
battery tried to get away. One gun was overcharged
and blown to pieces, and another overturned
by the Japanese, while the remainder made good
their escape. On the field lay three of the gunners
who had died at their post of duty.</p>

<p>When night fell the Japanese had gained an important
position to the east of Liao-Yang, and the
Russians had been driven back all along the line.
As tired as the soldiers were they were forced to
fortify the positions they had gained, and the artillery
was brought up, so as to be in readiness by daybreak.</p>

<p>It was not yet six o’clock when the contest was
renewed, but this was to the south and southwest.
For the command under Gilbert there was nothing
to do but to march down to the river. Here a crossing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>
was effected during the afternoon. The Russians
offered a slight show of resistance, and called
additional troops to the front during the night.</p>

<p>The next day the battle broke forth with renewed
fury. The batteries on both sides did their utmost
to silence each other, while the great plain in front
of Liao-Yang, many miles in extent, was filled with
the armies of the Czar and the Mikado, fighting
with a desperation and valor that could not be excelled.
At first the fighting of the infantry was at a
distance, but soon the armies drew closer and closer
to each other, and then came the shock of steel
against steel, while the batteries poured in their
awful fire from all sides. It was perfect inferno,
and before night fell the plain was strewn with thousands
upon thousands of dead and wounded.</p>

<p>“This cannot be kept up—it is beyond human
endurance,” said more than one soldier and officer
that night, when trying to catch a little rest. But
at dawn the contest was renewed, and tired as they
were the soldiers upon both sides went at it as
bravely as before. But the Russians could not hold
their defenses, and alarmed by the movement to cut
him off from a possible retreat northward, General
Kuropatkin fell back, and the next day ordered his
army to evacuate Liao-Yang.</p>

<span class="fs80">FACE TO FACE—CONCLUSION</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The report that Liao-Yang was being abandoned
by the Russians spread with lightning-like rapidity
through the Japanese army, and many were the cries
of <em>Banzai</em> which rent the air. Although wearied to
the last degree many of the soldiers were for pressing
forward, and clinching the victory gained, and
the onward movement was begun just as quickly as
necessary supplies could be brought to the front.</p>

<p>When Liao-Yang was entered by the Japanese it
presented a truly terrible spectacle. The Russian
portion of the town was in ruins, and a large part of
the Chinese quarters had been sacked, the shops
broken open, and contents strewn everywhere. Many
buildings were burning, and a heavy smoke hung
over all. The Japanese shell fire had caused heavy
destruction at certain points, and many Chinese and
Russian dead were found in the houses and on the
streets.</p>

<p>General Kuroki was still of a mind to turn the
Russian flank, if it could possibly be done, and for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>
that purpose a large portion of his army struck
northward, in columns almost parallel to the columns
of the enemy. On several occasions the opposing
columns came into touch with each other, and some
lively skirmishes were the result.</p>

<p>“He’s going to try to hem in the Russians before
they reach Mukden,” said Gilbert. “If he is able
to do that, we may see worse fighting than we’ve
seen yet.”</p>

<p>“It can’t be worse than it was in the plain before
Liao-Yang,” replied Ben. “I never saw such a
horrible sight in my life. It was enough to give one
the nightmare.”</p>

<p>The command under Gilbert had been detached
from General Kuroki’s army and was now placed
on guard in the vicinity of Liao-Yang. Such a guard
was absolutely necessary, for the purpose of maintaining
order and to guard private property from the
depredations of the Chunchuses, and ordinary plunderers.</p>

<p>Gilbert’s first visit to the town was paid two days
after the worst of the fighting came to an end. He
was accompanied by Ben and a small detachment of
soldiers, who were to guard the property of certain
foreigners who had asked for protection.</p>

<p>The great majority of the Russians had left Liao-Yang,
but here and there one was discovered disguised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>
as a Chinaman, or else claiming to be a German
or some other foreigner. Those who had not
been soldiers or spies, and those who behaved themselves,
were not molested, but all others were
promptly placed under arrest.</p>

<p>“The town must have been a hot place while the
fighting was going on,” was Ben’s comment, as he
and his chum surveyed the scene before them.
“Just look how the shells ripped up that building
yonder, and how they riddled the house on the
corner.”</p>

<p>“You are right, Ben. And yet this can’t be a
patch to the bombardment at Port Arthur. They
have had to endure it for weeks and weeks. It must
be simply awful.”</p>

<p>“Do you think Port Arthur will fall?”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t wonder. Stoessel can’t hold out
forever, no matter how brave he and his garrison
are. Sooner or later their ammunition and food
will run out.”</p>

<p>As the pair walked along one of the streets they
passed a man in Chinese dress whose face looked
strangely familiar to Gilbert. The man stared at
Gilbert as if he had seen a ghost.</p>

<p>“That’s queer,” murmured the young captain,
and stopped short.</p>

<p>“What’s up?” demanded Ben.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span></p>

<p>“That fellow—I’ve seen him before. I think—Ah,
I have it! Wait a minute!”</p>

<p>Gilbert wheeled around and made after the man,
and caught him by the shoulder.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute,” said he, in Russian. “Don’t
you remember me?”</p>

<p>“Remember you?” stammered the man. “I—I——”</p>

<p>“I am Gilbert Pennington, of the Richmond Importing
Company. You are Nicholas Vanskynov,
the clerk who used to work for Ivan Snokoff.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” The clerk drew a long breath and grew
pale. “Do not—do not expose me, sire!” he
pleaded. “The Japanese—they will kill me!”</p>

<p>“What are you doing here?”</p>

<p>“I was working here, sire. After I left Port
Arthur I got a position with the coal company whose
mines are to the east of this town. On my word of
honor, sire, I have had nothing to do with the war!”</p>

<p>“I believe you, Vanskynov. Now that the Japanese
are in possession, what do you intend to do?”</p>

<p>“I know not. I have lost everything. My family
is suffering, and dare not show themselves to the
Japanese soldiers.”</p>

<p>“That is certainly ill luck.”</p>

<p>“You are, I see by your dress, a Japanese officer,”
went on the clerk with a little more confidence.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>
“Cannot you assist me? I shall be exceedingly
grateful.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I can—it depends upon how you’ve
been acting. Have you taken any part in the fighting,
or have you been a spy?”</p>

<p>“No! no! On my word of honor! I am not a
fighting man!”</p>

<p>“Tell me, have you seen or heard anything of
Ivan Snokoff since we parted at Port Arthur?”</p>

<p>“Have I seen him? He is here. Did you not
know that?”</p>

<p>“Here!” cried Gilbert. “Now?”</p>

<p>“He was here during the fighting, and before. I
have not seen him for three days.”</p>

<p>“Show me where he was stopping.”</p>

<p>“I will do that readily, sire. And you, you will
help me,” pleaded the clerk. He was lean, hungry,
hollow-eyed, and his clothing was in tatters.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll help you,” answered the young captain.</p>

<p>In a minute more they were on the way to the
Russian section of the town, Ben going along. They
had to pass a number of burnt buildings, and then
came to a side street which the fire had not touched,
but which had suffered much from Japanese shells
and solid shots.</p>

<p>“What has Ivan Snokoff been doing here?”
asked Gilbert, as they walked along.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span></p>

<p>“He has been supplying the Russian soldiers with
things to eat and to drink at high prices. He forced
them to buy from him through his confederate, Captain
Barusky.”</p>

<p>“Where is the captain?”</p>

<p>“He has retreated with his command in the direction
of Mukden.”</p>

<p>“You are sure Snokoff did not go with him?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am sure. But he may have followed
since.”</p>

<p>They were now coming to a well-built house at
the end of the street. The front door was open, but
as they approached it was suddenly slammed shut,
and bolted from the inside.</p>

<p>“That looks suspicious!” cried Gilbert, and
immediately drew his pistol, while Ben did the same.</p>

<p>“Hadn’t we better get help?” asked Ben. “If
that rascal is in there with some of his friends, he
may show fight.”</p>

<p>“Yes, get some of the guards we met at the upper
corner, Ben.”</p>

<p>Going up to the door, Gilbert knocked loudly.</p>

<p>“Open in the name of the Mikado!” he cried, in
Russian.</p>

<p>There was a stir within, but no one came to the
door. Then Albert heard hasty footsteps retreating
to the rear of the building.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span></p>

<p>“Watch this door and don’t let Snokoff escape,”
he said to the clerk.</p>

<p>“I will do my best, sire,” was the trembling answer.</p>

<p>Running around the side of the building, the
young captain was just in time to see the figure of a
man, bundle in hand, leaping from a back window.
The man was disguised as a Chinaman, and had his
face stained.</p>

<p>“Stop!” cried the young American. “Stop, or
I will fire!”</p>

<p>To this the man made no reply, but kept on running.
Raising his pistol, Gilbert fired, and the man
staggered and gave a cry of pain. The young captain
had aimed for his leg and the bullet had gone
true.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you stop when I told you?” asked
Gilbert as he came up. The man had sunk to the
ground at the foot of the small garden attached to
the building.</p>

<p>“I will have the law on you for this,” grumbled
the man, in broken Chinese.</p>

<p>“You cannot deceive me, Ivan Snokoff,” returned
Gilbert, in Russian. And reaching forward he
pulled off the false queue the Russian was wearing
and cast it on the ground.</p>

<p>“Ha! it’s Gilbert Pennington!” gasped the man.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>
“And in the uniform of a Japanese officer. Why
do you masquerade thus?”</p>

<p>“It is no masquerade. I am a Japanese officer,
Snokoff, and, let me add, I had a perfect right to
shoot you down when I did. You can be thankful
that I did not aim for your heart instead of your
leg.”</p>

<p>“An officer of the Japanese army!” groaned
Ivan Snokoff, and all his courage deserted him. “I
am lost!”</p>

<p>“You are a fine sneak and swindler, Snokoff.
You played a fine trick on me at Port Arthur.”</p>

<p>“It—it was all a—a mistake!” whined the other.
“All a mistake, I assure you, Mr. Pennington.
I mean to pay you every <em>ruble</em>, yes, every one!”</p>

<p>“If that’s the case, you had better pay up right
now,” and Gilbert glanced at the bundle Ivan
Snokoff had been carrying. “Or shall I take possession
of that?”</p>

<p>“No! no! Do not rob me of what little I possess!
This war has cost me so much! I will pay, yes,
every <em>ruble</em>!”</p>

<p>“Very well, see that you do,” answered the young
captain sternly.</p>

<p>By this time Ben had returned with a squad of six
Japanese soldiers. The house was searched, and then
put in charge of a guard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span></p>

<p>“I’m half of a mind to have you sent to prison,”
said Gilbert to Snokoff, although he knew such a
course would not be necessary.</p>

<p>“Do not, I beg of you,” pleaded the rascal. “I
will pay; have I not said so?”</p>

<p>“Very well, do so, and we can sign the papers
right here.”</p>

<p>Ben was called in, and also Nicholas Vanskynov.
When Ivan Snokoff saw his former clerk he was
furious.</p>

<p>“So it is you who have betrayed me!” he roared.
He was sitting with his wounded leg bound up
and resting on a bench. “Oh, that I might get at
you!”</p>

<p>“You leave him alone,” said Gilbert. “If you
do not, you will only get yourself into more trouble.”</p>

<p>The necessary papers were drawn up, and in the
presence of Ben and the clerk Snokoff paid over to
Gilbert all that was coming to the Richmond Importing
Company—half in gold and half in Russian
paper money, which the young captain knew was
just as good.</p>

<p>“Tell me, does he owe you anything?” asked
Gilbert of Nicholas Vanskynov, after this transaction
was completed.</p>

<p>“He does, three <em>rubles</em>. And more, too, for he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>
once promised to pay me more salary, but he never
did so.”</p>

<p>“What would the increase of salary have
amounted to?”</p>

<p>The clerk made a rapid calculation in his head.</p>

<p>“Not less than eighteen <em>rubles</em>.” His eyes glistened.
“But I will take fifteen, if I can get
them.”</p>

<p>“You villain! It is nothing more that I will
pay!” roared Ivan Snokoff.</p>

<p>“Not so fast, Snokoff,” said Gilbert coolly.
“You had better pay up and save trouble. Remember,
he can report you quite as well as I can.”</p>

<p>At this the rascal stormed greatly. But he saw
how helpless he was, and not caring to have more
trouble, he finally paid his former clerk what was
coming to him and ordered him to be gone. He
was then left to himself, and the guard was cautioned
to see to it that he did not escape.</p>

<p>“Well, that was certainly a piece of luck,” said
Gilbert, after the affair was over, and he had placed
the money in a safe place. “The folks at home will
be glad to hear of it.”</p>

<p>“Snokoff will never forgive you, Gilbert,” answered
Ben.</p>

<p>“Perhaps not. But I can’t help it—I only did
what was right,” returned the young captain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span></p>

<p>Here let me add a few words more, and then bring
to a close this story of stirring adventures while
fighting “Under the Mikado’s Flag.”</p>

<p>After the evacuation of Liao-Yang by the Russians
there came to Gilbert and Ben a short period of
well-earned rest, during which the two young officers
attended to several small wounds which they had
received, and did their best to fortify themselves for
the fighting still to come.</p>

<p>During this period of inactivity Ben received a
long letter from his brother Larry, in which the
sailor boy said the <em>Columbia</em> had arrived in safety
at Manila, and was then taking on her cargo for
Nagasaki. The letter had been delayed in various
ways, and was then many weeks old.</p>

<p>“Larry must have left Manila long ago,” said
Gilbert, as he read the communication. “If the
<em>Columbia</em> had a safe passage, she must have arrived
at Nagasaki before this. But perhaps she fell in
with some Russian warship. In that case she’d have
a whole lot of trouble.” The <em>Columbia</em> did fall in
with one of the ships of the enemy, and what befell
Larry at that time and afterward will be told in
another volume, to be entitled: “At the Siege
of Port Arthur; Or, A Young American in the
Japanese Navy.” In this tale we shall meet all our
friends again, and also learn something more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>
about Ivan Snokoff and his confederate, Captain
Barusky.</p>

<p>“I understand the Russians are sinking Japanese
transports wherever they can find them,” said Ben,
after reading the letter.</p>

<p>“Well; it’s more than likely that the Japanese
are doing the same to the Russian vessels,” returned
Gilbert. “One thing is sure, as great as has been
the fighting on land, the battles on the water are
equally hot.”</p>

<p>“And Japan is winning both on the land and on
the sea. Her navy must certainly be a good one.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps Larry will want to join the navy when
he learns of all that is going on.”</p>

<p>“If so, I can’t blame him. He’s a natural born
sailor boy, and something of a gunner to boot,” answered
Ben, but without dreaming of what was in
store for his brother.</p>

<p>For the time being the days passed quietly enough
for Gilbert and Ben. There was little for the young
officers to do; so here let us leave them, knowing
that, no matter what the future held in store for
them, they would never forget the days spent battling
“Under the Mikado’s Flag.”</p>

Gilbert Pennington, the hero of “On to Pekin,” and the other, Ben
Russell, who with his brothers, Larry and Walter, is so well known to the
